/**
 * The pre-paint script is hand-written ES5 that rebuilds, by eye, what
 * `serializeOverrides` builds from types. It cannot import that function — it
 * runs before the bundle exists — so the duplication is unavoidable and this is
 * what keeps it honest: run the real script against stubbed globals and compare
 * its sheet to the store's, character for character.
 *
 * **The comparison is only as good as what is fed to it**, which is why the main
 * fixture is generated from `ACCENT_TOKEN_NAMES` and `SESSION_MODE_IDS` rather
 * than written out. Hand-written cases can only ever exercise the tokens and
 * modes that existed when someone wrote them: add a fifth accent meaning or a
 * fourth session mode, forget the script's own hard-coded copies of those lists,
 * and every hand-written case still passes while the shipped accent flashes on
 * every cold load of the thing that was added. Generated, that is a failure.
 *
 * It is also the only test the script has at all, which matters because it
 * splices `localStorage` into a stylesheet. The injection cases below are the
 * point, not decoration.
 *
 * Pure by construction: the stubs are plain objects, so this stays inside the
 * "no DOM in `bun test`" rule without a jsdom.
