 *
 * Duplicating them here is deliberate and the test is what makes it safe. The
 * store needs to know a token's default in order to answer two questions the
 * cascade cannot: *is this one overridden* (so the reset control appears), and
 * *what does the swatch show before anything is chosen*. It cannot read them
 * back out of `getComputedStyle`, because by the time any of this runs the
 * no-flash script has already applied the overrides on top — the cascade holds
 * the current value, which is exactly not the default.
 *
 * The mode-dependence is §5.2's, not an accident: phosphor green belongs on
 * black and turns acidic on white, so Ink and Paper carry different values for
 * four of the five and are overridden separately.
