/**
 * The operator's accent overrides: the stored shape, the guard over it, and the
 * one stylesheet it becomes. Sits beside `theme-store` because it is the same
 * kind of state — UI-owned, device-local, and applied to the cascade rather than
 * held by the backend.
 *
 * **The overrides reach the cascade through one `<style>` element, not through
 * inline styles on `<html>`.** That is the whole design, and it follows from one
 * fact: the overrides are *per theme mode*, and the theme changes at runtime — a
 * `"system"` preference flips with the OS while the page is open. An inline
 * style can only hold one theme's values, so every flip would have to rewrite
 * it, and any moment the two disagreed would paint the wrong palette. A
 * stylesheet carrying both rules lets the existing `[data-theme]` switch do the
 * selecting, which means `applyTheme` needs no knowledge of accents at all.
 *
 * The same trick carries the second axis. `data-mode` on the root says which
 * kind of thread is open (`session-mode.ts`), and the sheet emits
 * `html[data-theme=…][data-mode=…]` rules for the signature token — so switching
 * threads repaints the signature with no code running at all.
 *
 * `html[data-theme="…"]` is specificity (0,1,1) and the session rule (0,2,1),
 * which beat tokens.css's `:root` / `[data-theme="paper"]` (0,1,0) and its
 * session block (0,2,0) regardless of where the sheet lands in source order — so
 * none of this depends on load timing.
 *
 * Because theme.css maps the tokens with Tailwind's `@theme inline`, overriding
 * the raw `--accent*` custom property is enough to move everything downstream:
 * every `text-*`/`bg-*` utility, `--shadow-accent`/`--shadow-alert` (which are
 * `color-mix`es of `--accent`), the reasoning wall's tint, and every `LedEdge`
 * tone, whose `--led` resolves from these same properties. Nothing else needs
 * to know this feature exists.
 *
 * The per-axis accessors live next door — `accent-store.ts` for the five accent
 * meanings, `session-accent-store.ts` for the signature per session mode. Both
 * write through `update` here, because there is one sheet and one stored blob:
 * two modules each owning half of a single `<style>` element would leave the
 * winner up to whichever wrote last.
