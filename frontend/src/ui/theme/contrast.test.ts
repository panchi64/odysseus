   The diagram register.

   A rendered diagram is the one surface whose colours are written into the
   markup as LITERALS rather than left to the cascade — it has to be, since the
   same markup is handed to an `<img>` in the lightbox, where no custom property
   reaches it. `mermaidTheme` reads those literals back out of `<html>`, so the
   values it emits are exactly the tokens below and nothing else. This is where
   the pairs it rests on are held to a floor.

   Two floors, not one, and the split is WCAG's: an edge is a graphical object
   (1.4.11, 3:1) and a label is text (1.4.3, 4.5:1). Reading tokens.css rather
   than restating its hexes, the way `accents.test.ts` does.
