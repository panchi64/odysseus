/** A console group (§10.14): a frame, a header band, and flush ruled rows.

 *  **This is the one shell allowed to be a box.** §7 makes a border the last resort
 *  and this is the case it is last for: the rows inside are flush by construction, so
 *  there is no gap for space to work in, and they must read as set *into* the panel
 *  rather than lifted off it, so surface value cannot do it either. Both of the other
 *  devices are unavailable, which is exactly when a real border is justified.
 *
 *  **What goes in one:** ruled rows and fixed cells — content read by scanning a
 *  column, at the §3 tabular density. **What does not:** prose, forms, or a stack of
 *  cards. `Panel` is still the default container and stays the default; reach for this
 *  only when the content is genuinely a readout and the frame is what says where that
 *  readout begins and ends.
 *
 *  Square by construction (§7): anything in a ruled grid takes `radius-0`, and rounding
 *  the frame would leave the rows inside it mitred against a curve.
