/**
 * A colour swatch that opens the OS picker, with the design system's contrast
 * floor reported underneath it.
 *
 * The warning is the reason this is a component rather than a bare
 * `<input type="color">`. The system's accents used to clear 4.5:1 by
 * construction — they were fixed values tuned once (§12). An operator who can
 * set them can also set an alert red that vanishes into black, and the only
 * honest way to allow that is to allow it *and say so*. So the field warns and
 * never blocks: it is the operator's interface, and a contrast ratio is
 * information, not a permission.
 *
 * The hex sits in mono `meta` and the label in sans, because they are the two
 * voices (§2) — the name is the interface speaking, the value is a number the
 * machine will hand to the cascade.
 *
 * The native input is the picker, but it is not the swatch: it is stretched
 * invisibly over a `<label>` that draws the colour itself, so the visible
 * control keeps the house corner radius and the hairline ring that is the only
 * thing separating a white swatch from Paper's white page.
