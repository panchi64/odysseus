   `console` is the one exception, and it is a size because the voice comes with the

   header, status bar and registration marks are all the machine's line, and a sans
   sentence-case key there read as a web form's button bolted onto an instrument. It is
   taller than `md` so the key sits by the field's line of text rather than under it,
   and it carries its chord as a half-opacity suffix the caller passes as a child.
