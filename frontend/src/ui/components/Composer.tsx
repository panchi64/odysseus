     used to be separate branches, then a rounded card with a loose row of controls
     floating under it; now both are a single square frame (`line-strong`, §10.12):
     the card on top — the header line, the chips, then one row of the field
     (taking the width) with the commit keys at its right, bottom-aligned so they
     stay by the last line as the field grows — and the status bar joined to its
     underside, one rule between them. Only padding differs between the sizes.

     The bar is part of the unit because it is about this message and this thread,
     and a row floating loose under a card read as page furniture that happened to
     sit there. It is still *not* the card: it carries no fill, so the writing
     surface stays the one lit, raised thing in the frame, and its cells are the
     machine's line (mono, lowercase, hairline-ruled) where the card holds the
     operator's words. The card stays the drop target: it is where the operator is
     already looking.

     The unit is marked as the point of action AT REST, not on hover or focus (§6):
     the composer is the point of the screen whether or not the cursor is in it.
     Two marks, whatever the edge: registration ticks outside the four corners —
     dim at rest, info while a run streams, the same blue as everything else live —
     and the edge light (`edge`). `bloom` is the wide ambient aura for a composer
     that *is* the screen; `led` is a lit strip along the top edge for the docked
     case, where the aura's reach would wash over the transcript above it. */
