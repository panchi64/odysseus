 *  4px on the other. Nothing failed — it just looked very slightly wrong, which
 *  is the hardest kind of bug to see.
 *
 *  They must also stay **literal class names**. Tailwind generates a utility only

 *  inline style and its height is `100%` — an SVG stretched to track that would
 *  need `preserveAspectRatio="none"`, which scales the two strokes by different
 *  factors and gives the `+` visibly unequal arms.
 *
 *  `bg-dim`, not `bg-line`: a mark is not a border. `--line` is tuned to be the
 *  faintest thing that still separates two surfaces, and at 1px on a dark panel
 *  it disappears — a thin stroke reads dimmer than a filled area of the same
 *  colour. These are registration marks and are meant to be seen.
 *
 *  12px against the `-1.5` (6px) offsets below, so the mark straddles the corner
 *  it names with its centre exactly on it. Positioning is by inset, never by
 *  `-translate-x-1/2`: the carriers animate `transform`, and a centring

/**
 * **A region that draws its own frame before it fills.** The View panel's
 * arrival: a single `+` at the origin corner splits, one half travelling along
 * the top edge with a rule drawn between them, then both drop down the sides
 * with a rule closing the bottom — and the glass surface resolves inside the
 * frame that has just been described. Closing runs the gesture in reverse, so
 * the panel is taken apart rather than switched off.
 *
 * It is a sibling of `Reveal`, not a variant of it. `Reveal` says *content
 * materialized here*; this says *a place was made, and then filled*. That is
 * worth a second component only because the View is a region the operator
 * deliberately opens — a fade would say it had always been there and the light
 * had merely come up.
 *
 * **The budget is `--motion-stage` (320ms), and that is not a new exception.**
 * §8 grants the stage token to "a whole region arriving or leaving"; the View's
 * previous `Reveal` already ran at it, and this replaces that reveal. The phases
 * overlap by 20ms on purpose: two strictly sequential beats inside 320ms read as
 * a stutter, where an overlap reads as one continuous L-shaped gesture. The
 * timeline lives in `theme.css` under THE CONSTRUCTION REVEAL — this file owns
 * the geometry, that file owns the choreography.
 *
 * **The content is one fade, never a stagger.** §8 forbids staggered cascades,
 * and this is one region arriving rather than a list of things: the surface and
 * everything inside it resolve together, on a single animation.
 *
 * **Every moving part rides a full-size carrier, not the mark itself.** A
 * percentage `translate` resolves against the *animated element's own* border
 * box, so translating a 12px mark by 100% moves it 12px — not across the panel.
 * Each mark therefore sits at its destination inside an `inset-0` carrier, and
 * the carrier is what travels: 100% of the carrier is 100% of the panel, which
 * is the distance actually wanted, at any width the resize handle produces.
