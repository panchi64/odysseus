 *  sitting 5 + 2, and the three dead positions read as a row that failed to finish
 *  rather than as the end of the panel. Filling the rows as evenly as possible instead
 *  puts seven in one row of seven where there is room, and 4 + 3 where there is not.
 *
 *  It cannot always reach zero — nine cells at a cap of eight is 5 + 4 whatever is
 *  chosen — so this minimizes the gap rather than promising none. The alternative that
 *  *would* promise none is letting the last row's cells stretch, and that is rejected:
 *  the columns would stop aligning between rows, which is the ruled structure §7 keeps
 *  the borders for in the first place.

 *
 *  **The operator reads this panel by looking for the lit one.** That is the whole
 *  design and the reason it replaced a flat strip of equally-bright cells: a band has
 *  to be read left to right every time, where a matrix with one amber cell in it has
 *  already answered the question from across the room. §1.1 — volume is hierarchy —
 *  applied to a region that was violating it.
 *
 *  **A cell is two lines: the legend, and why it is lit.** The second line is reserved
 *  whether or not the cell is lit, so a capability degrading changes a cell's contents
 *  and never its size — the grid cannot reflow under the operator. The reason used to
 *  be set in a list beneath the grid, which restated every legend in order to say the
 *  thing the cell it named had room for, and grew the panel by a line per fault.
 *
 *  **Caution is a tint; alert is a solid fill.** That is the §12 rule doing real work:
 *  with the reason occupying the second line there is no status *word* left, so the two
 *  severities would otherwise be told apart by hue alone. Fill weight is a luminance
 *  difference — it survives any colour vision, and it is what an actual caution-and-
 *  warning panel does, where a master alarm does not merely glow a different colour
 *  from a caution. Lit and unlit stay distinguishable by a third, independent channel:
 *  an unlit cell's second line is empty.
 *
 *  Square, ruled, `space-1`/`space-2` — the tabular-density exception of §3, and the
 *  ruled-grid border of §7.
