/**
 * Draw the diagrams an answer contained.
 *
 * `markdownMermaid` emits an **empty** placeholder carrying its source in a data
 * attribute, precisely so nothing is drawn at parse time; this is the pass that
 * picks those up afterwards. It is a DOM pass rather than a component for the
 * same reason `hydrateRemoteImages` is: the prose around it is parsed markdown
 * injected as HTML, so there is no JSX seam to hang a component off. It is
 * idempotent per node (a placeholder already mounted is skipped), which is what
 * makes it safe to re-run on every streaming delta.
 *
 * Three things are load-bearing here:
 *
 * **Mermaid is imported on the first diagram and never before.** It is a layout
 * engine with a parser generator behind it — larger than everything else in the
 * markdown path put together — and most threads never contain a diagram. The
 * `import("mermaid")` below is the only reference to it in the app, so the
 * bundler keeps it in a chunk of its own.
 *
 * **A diagram is a console group.** The frame is that shell, reused rather than
 * rebuilt: `plate` legend at the left of the header band, a readout at the
 * right, and the drawing set into the body. That is the one shell allowed to be
 * a box, and it is allowed because its content is a readout — which a diagram
 * is. Arrival goes through `Reveal`, opening large through `Lightbox`.
 *
 * **The SVG is sanitized before it is adopted.** Mermaid renders under
 * `securityLevel: "strict"` with `htmlLabels: false`, which is the first fence;
 * the walk in `sanitize` is the second. Model-authored source reaching a layout
 * engine that emits markup is exactly the shape that wants two.
