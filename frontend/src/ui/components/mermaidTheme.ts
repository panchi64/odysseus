/**
 * The design system, expressed as something mermaid can be configured with.
 *
 * Mermaid takes **literal colours** — `themeVariables` has no idea what a custom
 * property is, and `themeCSS` is serialised into the generated `<svg>`, which is
 * a subtree the cascade reaches but which must still carry its own values for the
 * lightbox (where the same markup is handed to an `<img>` and stops inheriting
 * anything at all). Odysseus has two themes, a signature accent that moves with
 * `data-mode`, and per-mode operator overrides on top of both, so a hardcoded
 * palette would be wrong three different ways.
 *
 * So the values are *read back out of the cascade* — `getComputedStyle` on
 * `<html>`, which is where every one of those three layers has already resolved —
 * and re-emitted as literals. Nothing in here declares a colour of its own; the
 * fallbacks exist only for the case where a property is missing entirely, and
 * they are the Ink shipped values.
 *
 * Four things stock mermaid does that the system forbids, and what is done here
 * instead:
 *
 *   1. **Colour.** Its palette is decorative; a screen at rest is grayscale. The
 *      diagram is built from `surface`/`text` and spends accents only on the one
 *      focused node and on severity — at most two hues, enforced in
 *      `diagramThemeCss`.
 *   2. **Borders.** It strokes every node. Space, then surface value, then the
 *      shadow's ring; a real border is the last resort and a node is not that
 *      case. Nodes are `surface-raised` fills with no stroke at all.
 *   3. **The two voices.** It sets labels in sans. A node in an architecture
 *      diagram is an identifier naming a region — that is `plate`, and an edge
 *      label reporting a condition is `meta`.
 *   4. **Severity by hue.** Caution is a *tint* and alert is a *solid fill*, so
 *      the two separate on luminance and survive any colour vision. The label on
 *      a filled node is chosen by measurement (`legibleOn`), not assumed, because
 *      white on the shipped alert red measures 3.0:1 and black on it measures
 *      6.9:1 — and on Paper that verdict reverses.
