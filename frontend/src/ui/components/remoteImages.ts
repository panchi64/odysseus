/**
 * Resolve the images an answer embedded, without the operator's browser ever
 * contacting the host that serves them.
 *
 * `markedLinks` renders a remote image as an `<img>` with **no `src`** and its
 * address in `data-remote-src`, precisely so nothing loads on parse. This pass
 * walks that markup and fills the `src` in from `/media/remote-image`, which
 * fetches the bytes backend-side and validates them (services/webimage.py). The
 * request that leaves this machine's browser is same-origin; the one that reaches
 * the remote host comes from the backend and carries no operator identity.
 *
 * It is a DOM pass rather than a component because the prose around it is parsed
 * markdown injected as HTML — there is no JSX seam to hang a component off. It is
 * idempotent (an `<img>` that already has a `src` is skipped), which is what makes
 * it safe to re-run on every streaming delta.

/** Resolved object URLs by remote address, shared across every Markdown instance.
 *
 *  This cache is what makes the pass safe to run mid-stream: the trailing block
 *  re-parses on *every* delta, so an image in it would otherwise be re-fetched
 *  dozens of times and flash back to empty on each one. Keyed by the remote URL,
 *  so the same picture referenced twice resolves once.
 *
 *  Capped, and eviction revokes — an object URL pins its bytes in memory until it
 *  does, and these are images. Oldest-first (Map preserves insertion order),
 *  matching the block parse cache next door. */
