/**
 * **A region that opens and closes over its own height**, without the caller
 * knowing what that height is.
 *
 * Use it wherever content genuinely comes and goes — a status line that has
 * something to say only while work is running, a panel revealing, a summary that
 * appears once there is something to summarize. The alternative is content
 * vanishing, which takes everything below it with it: a jump the reader has to
 * re-find their place after, and the single most common reason a screen "feels
 * like it redrew".
 *
 * Two details it gets right that a naive version does not:
 *
 * - **It leaves nothing behind.** Once closed, it unmounts — but only *after*
 *   the closing transition ends. A collapsed element that stays mounted is
 *   invisible and still consumes its parent's `gap`, so a spaced stack keeps a
 *   hole exactly where the thing used to be.
 * - **It does not animate on mount.** Transitions never run on initial render,
 *   so a region that mounts open simply is open. That is what keeps a long
 *   transcript still on load instead of unfolding a hundred regions at once
 *   (§8 — nothing animates that the operator is not watching).
 *
 * **Use `Reveal` instead when the region mounts at the moment it opens.** This
 * animates on a transition, and a transition needs a previous computed value —
 * an element that did not exist a moment ago has none, so it renders at its end
 * state and appears instantly. Forcing a style flush between the two is supposed
 * to fix that and does not reliably. `Reveal` animates on a keyframe, which
 * carries its own start and therefore plays on mount; that is why the View
 * panel uses it. Reach for `Collapse` when the region is already on screen and
 * has to give its space back — which is the case it is written for and the only
 * one exercised today.

  /* What the DOM currently reflects, which lags `props.open` on the opening
     edge — and that lag is the entire reason opening animates at all.

     A transition needs a *previous* computed value. A region that opens in
     response to a click mounts at that moment, so rendering it open immediately
     means the browser's first computed style for the element is the open one:
     there is nothing to transition from, and it appears instantly. So it is
     mounted closed, the closed style is forced to compute, and only then does it
     open.

     The forced read is what makes this reliable — waiting a frame is not enough
     and is not deterministic. `offsetWidth` flushes pending style and layout, so
     the closed value is genuinely committed before the open one is set, which is
     exactly the condition a transition needs.

     Mounting already open — a page loading with the panel out — is the one case
     that must NOT animate, and it doesn't: `shown` starts at `props.open`, so
     there is no edge to cross. That is what keeps a transcript of collapsed
     regions still on load. */
