 * rule is what makes a run of short readouts scan as a row of cells rather than as
 * words with odd gaps between them.
 *
 * It is not an `InstrumentBand` and deliberately so. A band is a readout —
 * label-over-value cells the operator reads; this is a control strip whose cells are
 * mostly things to press, one line tall, in the same mono as the readouts beside them.
 *
 * **It wraps rather than overflowing.** The start group keeps its place and its cells
 * wrap within it; the end group is pushed right with `ml-auto` and drops to its own
 * line still right-aligned when the two no longer fit side by side. A cell that holds
 * something long (a model id) should cap and truncate inside itself, so it gives way
 * before its neighbours are pushed onto a line of their own.
