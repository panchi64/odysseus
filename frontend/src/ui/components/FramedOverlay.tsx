/**
 * **A centered overlay that builds its own frame.** The `ConstructionReveal`
 * container the View panel already uses, pinned to the middle of the viewport
 * over a dimmed page: the `+` splits from the origin corner, travels the top
 * edge, drops down the sides, and the glass resolves inside the frame it just
 * described. Closing takes it apart again.
 *
 * It exists because two overlays now want that arrival — the settings dialog and
 * the navigation palette — and a second hand-rolled copy of the portal, the
 * backdrop, the escape key and the four traps below would have drifted from the
 * first within a release.
 *
 * **This is not `Modal`, and could not be built on it.** `Modal`'s backdrop is
 * the *ancestor* of its dialog, which is fine for an opaque card and fatal here:
 * see the backdrop-root note below.
 *
 * Four things it is easy to break, every one of which fails silently — the page
 * still renders, it just quietly stops being glass:
 *
 * - **The backdrop is a SIBLING of the reveal, never its parent.** `backdrop-filter`
 *   only blurs what is painted inside its *backdrop root*, and `opacity < 1` on any
 *   ancestor creates one — which the backdrop's own fade animation does for as long
 *   as it runs. Nest the reveal inside it and `.ody-glass` blurs nothing while its
 *   translucent fill still tints, so the result reads as a slightly lighter panel
 *   rather than as anything broken. Same reason `ConstructionReveal`'s wrapper is
 *   `relative` and not `relative isolate`.
 * - **The dialog carries no fill.** The frosted surface *is* the framed region the
 *   reveal draws; a `bg-*` here stacks a second layer over it and paints the page
 *   behind out. Anything inside is `Panel bare`.
 * - **The centering layer spans the viewport but takes no clicks** — it has to be
 *   full-size for `place-items-center` to center against the viewport, so it is
 *   `pointer-events-none` and the reveal re-enables them. Without that it would
 *   cover the backdrop and swallow every dismissing click.
 * - **Centering goes on that layer; the reveal is sized to the dialog.** The frame
 *   is drawn on the reveal's own wrapper, so pinning *that* to the viewport puts
 *   the corner marks in the corners of the screen — which is what the View's
 *   full-screen sheet wants, and wrong for a dialog.
