   *  an ungated reveal is content arriving in a place that keeps it, where an

/**
 * **The one way something in the human voice arrives.** Wraps its children in an
 * element that *materializes* — resolving out of a blur while it fades, and with
 * `rise`, settling the last few pixels into place as it does.
 *
 * The blur is the load-bearing part. Fading opacity alone reads as a light being
 * turned up on something that was already sitting there; coming out of a blur
 * reads as the thing arriving. It is the difference between revealed and made.
 *
 * Reach for it whenever the interface puts something on screen on the operator's
 * behalf: a panel revealing, a section expanding, a result landing. The register
 * is the point (§8) — anything the interface does eases, and anything the
 * *machine* does snaps, so a mono readout must never be wrapped in this. That
 * contrast is what lets the operator tell the two apart without reading a word.
 *
 * Two things about how it comes and goes:
 * - **Ungated, it never exits.** Content that simply arrives somewhere and stays
 *   should leave the instant it is no longer wanted; an exit animation there
 *   only delays the operator. Pass `when` and it gains one — see that prop.
 * - **It does not animate on every update.** The animation fires on mount. To
 *   replay it, change `when` — or key the subtree, if the content itself is what
 *   changed.
 *
 * For a case that cannot take a wrapper — a portal root, a node built by hand —
 * the underlying `.ody-fade-in` / `.ody-rise` classes are still there.
