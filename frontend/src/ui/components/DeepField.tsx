/** The licensed moment (§11.1) — a graticule, the limb of something large, and a
 *  scatter of stars, drawn behind a whole page.
 *
 *  **It is the page's ground, not a region's.** It was originally cropped to one
 *  region (the launchpad's composer band), which left the limb sliced off at an edge
 *  the composition never anticipated — a horizon is only enormous if you can see it
 *  run the width of the frame. It now backs the entire content column on the screens
 *  that carry it, and the framed surfaces on those screens go **glass** (`.ody-framed`
 *  under `.ody-field-page`) so the field is frosted out from behind anything holding
 *  words. That pairing is the whole reason a page-wide field is not the "atmosphere in
 *  the reading path" failure §11 exists to prevent: nothing readable sits *on* the
 *  field, only in front of a blurred copy of it.
 *
 *  **Still one per screen**, and still only where it backs the page rather than a
 *  panel: the launchpad and the 404 today. Never inside a container holding data, and
 *  deliberately not a prop on `EmptyState` — that is a panel's empty arm, not a
 *  screen's.
 *
 *  **It loses every fight it picks.** The neutral marks run at single-digit alpha and
 *  only the limb takes `--accent`, at 22% — enough that the figure follows the session
 *  mode and any operator accent override, not enough to spend the accent budget (§5.4).
 *
 *  The composition is drawn at **4:3** (1200×900) and anchored **bottom**
 *  (`xMidYMax`). Both choices are about what `slice` throws away. A content column is
 *  roughly square, so `slice` scales the figure by its HEIGHT and eats the width — at
 *  16:10 that was 45% of the composition, which is most of the star field and the ends
 *  of the limb. At 4:3 the crop is a tenth of that. And the limb is the one element
 *  whose position carries meaning, so the vertical crop is spent on the stars above it
 *  rather than on the horizon.
 *
 *  Static by construction. A drifting starfield would be decoration that moves, which
 *  is the one thing worse than decoration, and it would put the human motion register
 *  somewhere the operator is trying to read. Nothing here animates, so there is nothing
 *  for `prefers-reduced-motion` to collapse.
 *
 *  Purely decorative, so `aria-hidden` and `pointer-events-none`: it must never take a
 *  click meant for what sits on top of it.

          is a 66px rise from the edges of the page to its middle.
