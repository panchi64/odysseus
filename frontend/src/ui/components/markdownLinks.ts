/**
 * Anchors for the `marked` pipeline (see Markdown.tsx) — the single place a link
 * in rendered prose is minted.
 *
 * Links are a *feature*: the model is told (prompts/agent.py) that Markdown link
 * syntax renders, so it can put a page it actually visited behind the words that
 * describe it instead of trailing a bare URL. That makes every anchor on screen
 * model-authored, and a model that just read a web page is relaying untrusted
 * text — so this module is also the chokepoint that makes those anchors safe:
 *
 *   • `link` — scheme-allowlisted (`http`/`https`/`mailto`), attribute-escaped,
 *     and opened in a new tab with the opener severed. A rejected href degrades
 *     to the link's own text rather than to a dead or dangerous anchor.
 *   • `link`, second form — a **path** rather than a URL, which the model is
 *     told to write when it is pointing the operator at a file of theirs. It is
 *     not a destination and never becomes an `href`: it is parked in
 *     `data-open-path` for Markdown.tsx's delegated handler to POST to
 *     `/host/open`, which refuses anything outside the operator's own project
 *     roots. Given a path is model-authored text, the check here is only that it
 *     is a path *shape* at all — the fence is the backend's, deliberately, since
 *     a rule about which files may be opened cannot live in the browser.
 *   • `image` — emitted with its address parked in `data-remote-src` and no `src`
 *     at all, for Markdown.tsx to resolve through the backend proxy. An `<img>`
 *     is the one construct that *fetches the instant it has a src*, with no click
 *     to gate it, so a relayed `![](https://…/p.gif?id=…)` pointed straight at
 *     its host would be a tracking pixel loaded from the operator's own browser,
 *     carrying their address and cookies. The picture is worth showing; the
 *     request is not worth making from here. See services/webimage.py.
 *   • `html` — raw HTML in the source is escaped to visible text rather than
 *     injected. Prose here is Markdown; passing `marked`'s raw-HTML tokens
 *     through to `innerHTML` would hand an `<a href="javascript:…">` (or an
 *     `<img onerror>`) a way around the two renderers above, and there is
 *     nothing an answer needs to say that Markdown can't.

 *  navigate it off its own route on a click. A path is not an exception to that;
