/**
 * Diagram fences for the `marked` pipeline (see Markdown.tsx).
 *
 * A ```` ```mermaid ```` block is claimed here before `marked`'s own fenced-code
 * tokenizer sees it, and rendered as an **empty placeholder element** carrying
 * its source in a data attribute. Nothing is drawn at parse time and mermaid is
 * not imported: `hydrateMermaid` picks the placeholder up afterwards, modelled
 * on how `remoteImages` picks up an `<img>` with no `src`.
 *
 * That split is what keeps `cachedParse` synchronous. Markdown.tsx parses a
 * block to an HTML *string* and caches it by source; a renderer that had to
 * await a layout engine could not participate in that at all, and making the
 * whole parse async would turn every streaming delta into a frame of blank
 * prose.
 *
 * **An unterminated fence is the normal case, not an error.** While the model is
 * typing, the last block in the answer is a fence with no closer, and it stays
 * that way for as many deltas as the diagram takes to write. It is marked
 * `data-mermaid-partial` and the hydrator renders a quiet frame for it — never a
 * parse error, which would otherwise flash on screen for the whole time the
 * model is drawing.
 *
 * The fence's info string past the word `mermaid` is taken as the legend for the
 * frame's header band (```` ```mermaid Call path ````). It is a caption the
 * model wrote, so it is escaped into an attribute like everything else here and
 * rendered as `plate` text, never as markup.
