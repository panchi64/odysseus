 *  **The panel is portalled to `document.body` and positioned `fixed`.** It used to be
 *  an `absolute` child of the trigger, which had two failure modes that looked like
 *  one: near the bottom of the window it ran off-screen, and inside any scroll
 *  container — the chat transcript, a modal body, the viewport panel — it was *clipped*
 *  by that ancestor's `overflow`, which no amount of `align` tuning could fix. A portal
 *  escapes every ancestor's overflow and stacking context; fixed coordinates measured
 *  from the anchor keep it in place.
 *
 *  Placement flips above the anchor when there is more room there, and shifts
 *  horizontally to stay inside the viewport. It is recomputed on scroll (capture phase,
 *  so scroll containers fire it too, not just the window), on resize, and **whenever the
 *  panel's own content changes size** — a disclosure opening inside it, a list filtering
 *  down. That last one is not a refinement: a placement measured once is wrong in the
 *  one direction that hurts, since a panel placed below an anchor with just enough room
 *  keeps growing *downward* off the bottom of the window, and the clamp that would have
 *  made it scroll was decided when it was still small. */
