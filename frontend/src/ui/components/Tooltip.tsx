   `max-w` + `whitespace-normal`: the tip soft-wraps at a readable measure instead
   of running out of the window as one line. Short labels — the numeric readouts
   under the composer — never reach the cap and so still render on a single line;
   only a real sentence wraps, which is the point. `break-words` is the backstop
   for the one thing wrapping can't help with, an unbroken token (a long path, a
   model id) wider than the cap. */

/** Hover/focus tooltip.
 *
 *  **Always portaled to `document.body` and positioned `fixed`** — the same move,
 *  and the same reasoning, as `Popover`. It used to default to an `absolute` child
 *  of its own trigger and portal only when a caller passed `float`, which put the
 *  burden of knowing about clipping on all 32 call sites: any tip inside a
 *  scrolling or `overflow-hidden` ancestor — the transcript, the readout line under
 *  the composer, a panel — was cut off by it, and whether it happened to be cut off
 *  was a property of where the component was mounted rather than of anything the
 *  caller said. A portal escapes every ancestor's overflow and stacking context;
 *  the placement then flips and clamps against the viewport, so a tip near an edge
 *  moves instead of overflowing. */
