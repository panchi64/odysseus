 * A labelled show/hide section — marker, label, collapsing body.

 * that flips on open, a dim label that brightens on hover, and the body beneath. Works
 * controlled (pass `open` + `onToggle`) or uncontrolled.
 *
 * **The body opens over its own height** (`Collapse`) rather than appearing outright.
 * Content that simply vanishes takes everything below it with it, which is the single
 * most common reason a screen reads as having redrawn — and a disclosure is the exact
 * case that rule is written for.
 *
 * The plus/minus `marker` is what lets the rail's area headers and the thread list's
 * workspace headings live here instead of hand-rolling a header each. Both used to, and
 * the copies had already drifted apart on the accessible name and on which parts of the
 * row take the hover fill.
 *
 * One shape still can't be this component: the nav rail's header is a *link* with the
 * toggle beside it (a button inside a link is invalid HTML, the same reason `ListRow`'s
 * `right` slot is a span). `DisclosureToggle` is that control on its own, so even the
 * exception shares the aria and the paint.
 *
 * `ToolCallCard` and its siblings also stay off this: their trigger row carries a whole
 * cluster of controls, and covering that would mean prop-configuring arbitrary trigger
 * children, at which point the component stops being simpler than the markup it hides.
 * They share `ProcessRow` instead.
