/**
 * Transcript scroll bench — a dev-only harness, not a product surface.
 *
 * It exists because the thing being measured cannot be measured in the app: the
 * transcript's cost is a function of thread length, and a real long thread is the
 * operator's private data behind a lock this harness has no way through. So the
 * fixture is synthetic and the route is a SIBLING of `(app).tsx` — outside
 * `RequireAuth`, outside `AppShell` — which is what lets a profiler load it with no
 * backend, no session, and nothing of the operator's on screen. `models.ts` gates its
 * resources on `session.isAuthenticated`, so `MessageItem`'s model label resolves to
 * `""` without a single fetch.
 *
 * **The container is copied from `TranscriptView`/`ChatRoomScreen`, not imported.**
 * Importing `TranscriptView` would drag in the stream, the viewport and the thread
 * actions — the whole room — and a bench that needs a running backend measures
 * nothing. What matters for paint is the scroll container's classes and the reading
 * measure, and those are reproduced verbatim below; `MessageItem` itself is the real
 * component, which is where all the DOM being measured comes from.
 *
 * Two modes, because a settled fixture does not reproduce the whole problem:
 *   ?mode=settled  — history render. Every turn arrives complete.
 *   ?mode=streamed — a driver grows each answer a chunk per frame with
 *                    `streaming: true`, then settles it. This is the only way to
 *                    exercise the per-character reveal — the wrappers it puts in and,
 *                    once a block settles, takes back out.
 *
 * Flags toggle each candidate fix WITHOUT the fix being implemented, so a baseline and
 * every variant come out of one build:
 *   &n=40          turn pairs
 *   &cv=1          content-visibility on every turn but the last two
 *   &auto=1        run `compare()` as soon as the page is actually on screen
 *   &led=0         kill the rail LED's four-layer glow
 *   &legibility=0  drop `text-rendering: optimizeLegibility`
 *
 * Driven from the console (or a devtools protocol client) via `window.__bench`.

 *  zero dropped frames either way. What it bought was cover for a bug, at the price of

const PROSE = `## Resolving the fence

The grammar walk does not trust the declaration — it *checks* it. Every path the
command names is resolved against the worktree root, and a path that escapes it is
refused before anything else is asked. That ordering is the whole point: a question
about a command that was never going to be allowed is a question that wastes the
operator's attention.

- **workspace** — writes stay under the worktree, no egress at all
- **network** — egress to the allowed-domain list, still no host writes
- **host** — anything, and therefore always reviewed

An undeclared egress is not reviewed but denied outright, since a worktree profile
allows no domains in the first place. The reviewer never sees it.

\`\`\`python
def reach_of(cmd: Command) -> Reach:
    if any(p.escapes(root) for p in cmd.paths):
        raise Refused(cmd)
    return cmd.declared

that goes stale, and a structural check is not.
