/** A path with no route. The surfaces that became settings sections used to

 *  could be holding a link to one, so a dead path reads as dead.
 *
 *  **This screen carries §11.1's licensed moment**, and it is the clearest case the
 *  rule has: a 404 is a whole viewport with one small plate on it and nothing running,
 *  so there is nothing for the field to compete with or sit in front of. It is also
 *  the one screen the operator reaches by accident, which is the right place for the
 *  product to be quietly good-looking rather than merely correct.
 *
 *  It draws its own field rather than going through `isDeepFieldRoute`: this route is
 *  outside the `(app)` group, so there is no shell column here to paint behind. */

          marks, hairline rules, and the frosted `.ody-glass` surface inside them.
          It is reused rather than reproduced on `RegistrationFrame`, which draws
          marks and no surface: a second "framed glass panel" in the system is two
          things to keep in step, and the frost is the whole point here. The field
          runs right under this plate, so a surface that merely tinted would leave
          a graticule crossing the words.

          `when` is a constant true. Everywhere else this component gates a region
          the operator deliberately opens, and the entry gesture says *a place was
          made, and then filled*; a 404 is not opened at all, but it is the one
          screen where the product has nothing to do but assemble itself in front
          of someone who arrived by mistake. There is no exit, because there is no
          state in which this screen closes. */}
