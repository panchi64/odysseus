/**
 * Does the app actually boot?
 *
 * Every other test here is a pure function. This one spawns the real dev server
 * and loads the real page in a headless WebView, which is the only thing that
 * catches the class of break no unit test can see: a module that fails to
 * resolve, a Vite plugin that stops emitting, a worker whose dynamic import
 * can't be bundled, a top-level throw during mount. All of those leave #app
 * empty while every unit test still passes.
 *
 * It runs without the Python backend. With nothing to talk to, RequireAuth's
 * boot probe parks on its splash — which is fine, because what is being
 * asserted is that the shell mounted at all, not what it decided to show.
 *
 * Excluded from `bun run test` (it costs ~15s); `bun run test:smoke` runs it.
