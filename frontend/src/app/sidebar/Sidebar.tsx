            `Operator` held the left of this strip and was a label, not a
            control — it named who was logged in, in a single-operator product
            where the answer never changes and nothing else asks. Settings was a
            row of its own directly above, looking like a destination while
            changing no route. Folding one into the other costs a row and gives
            the strip two controls that both act on the session.

            Settings still opens the dialog rather than navigating, which is why
            it is a button and not a `ListRow` with an `href`: a row that looks
            like every other destination but changes no route would be a lie
            about what clicking it does. */}
