 *
 * **Rows are surfaces, not categories.** The column used to list six umbrellas
 * and hide sixteen panes inside them, which meant knowing that "offline mode"
 * was filed under GENERAL before you could find it. Now the thing you came to
 * change is the thing you click, the headings only sort them, and the field at
 * the top skips the sorting entirely — type three letters and the hierarchy
 * stops mattering.
 *
 * A search result list is **flat and ranked** (label ▸ keyword ▸ description)
 * rather than grouped: once the operator has told us what they want, group
 * headers are furniture between them and it, so each row carries its group as
 * dim meta instead.
 *
 * Selection is the same raised fill the rail uses (§10 States), not a rule down
 * the side: this column already sits beside the pane, and a second vertical line
 * a few pixels from that edge reads as a mistake.
