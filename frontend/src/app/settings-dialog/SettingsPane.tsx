/**
 * The one place a section id becomes a component. `sections.ts` says what
 * exists and in what order; this says what each entry renders, and nothing else
 * knows both — so adding a section is one line in each file, and forgetting the
 * line here is what the dev warning below catches. It is a warning rather than a
 * test because importing this map constructs every feature's resources at module
 * load, and the unit suite has no DOM to hold them.
 *
 * Every value here is a **thunk**, not an element. Solid evaluates JSX eagerly,
 * so a map of elements would construct all sixteen sections — and create every
 * resource behind them — the moment this module is read, which is exactly the
 * cost the dialog's mount-only-while-open gate exists to avoid.
