 *
 * **Each row is one surface, not an umbrella.** The dialog used to list six
 * categories, each stacking three-to-five unrelated sections into one long pane,
 * so finding the offline switch meant knowing it lived under GENERAL and then
 * scrolling past the theme picker. An operator does not think in categories —
 * they think in the thing they came to change. So the column lists the things,
 * the groups only sort them, and the search field above skips the hierarchy
 * altogether.
 *
 * Ordering is deliberate rather than alphabetical: GENERAL first because it is
 * what an operator opens the dialog for most often, SYSTEM last because it is
 * where you go when something is already wrong.
