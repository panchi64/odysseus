/** Which model the next turn runs on.
 *
 *  **This is the backend `main` role binding, not a per-surface preference.** The
 *  store writes `PUT /models/roles/main`, which is the same fact every server-initiated
 *  consumer resolves — titling, research, scheduled tasks. Changing it here changes it
 *  for all of them, deliberately: there is one operator and one active model, and a
 *  device-local override would be a second answer to a question the backend already
 *  owns. Every instance of this component is therefore a view of one value and they
 *  cannot disagree.
 *
 *  It lives **in the composer's status bar** rather than the top bar. The model is not
 *  a property of the application, it is a property of the message about to be sent, and
 *  in the top bar it was a persistent global control on every screen — including the
 *  many with nothing to send. Under the input it is in the operator's eye-line at the one
 *  moment the choice matters, and it costs nothing on the screens that don't have one.
 *
 *  A `cell` because that bar is a ruled line of machine values, not a toolbar: a filled
 *  control there is the heaviest thing on it for a choice made once in a while (§7).
 *
 *  **It gives way first on a narrow bar.** A model id can run to forty characters, and
 *  the bar it shares with the level and the thread's readouts wraps at half width — so
 *  the picker is capped and truncates rather than pushing its neighbours onto a line of
 *  their own. The full name is one click away in the list, where it is not truncated.
 *
 *  **The list refreshes itself when it opens**, rather than sitting behind a refresh
 *  button. Opening the menu is already the operator saying "show me what I can pick",
 *  and a model that appeared since the app loaded — a local engine they just started —
 *  is exactly the one they opened it to find. The old button asked them to say it
 *  twice, and to somehow know the list in front of them was stale.
 *
 *  **And it says so while it does.** That refresh is a per-endpoint provider probe
 *  budgeted around three seconds, and until it answered the panel was the previous
 *  list — or, on a workspace whose backend hasn't been asked yet, the flat assertion
 *  that there are no models and the operator should go add an endpoint. Both are
 *  claims the app is in no position to make mid-probe. The note sits beside the
 *  trigger rather than inside the panel because the panel belongs to `Combobox`,
 *  which is shared: a state this picker alone has would be a prop on every other
 *  dropdown in the app that has nothing to refresh. */
