 *  list is a ration, and a route earns a place on it by having nothing that is read
 *  against the field — which is a fact about one screen and never inherited. Under
 *  `matchesHref` an entry like `/docs` would silently extend the field to every
 *  `/docs/*` detail page, each of them full of content and none of them reviewed.
