 *  dialogue against each model — not a one-shot. All run lifecycle is
 *  backend-owned; this screen only relays intent.
 *
 *  It was the COMPARE tab of the Model Cookbook, and it is a page rather than a
 *  settings section for the reason it was never really a cookbook tab either: it
 *  is a bench you work at, two live transcripts wide, and it wants the room. */
