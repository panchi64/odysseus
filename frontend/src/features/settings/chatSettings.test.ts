/**
 * The chat-settings wire mapping, in the one place it can go wrong quietly.
 *
 * A PUT here sends only the keys the caller touched, and "touched" is decided by an
 * `!== undefined` test rather than by truthiness. That distinction is invisible until a
 * setting has a meaningful falsy value — and two do: a `null` wall clock or `null`
 * sub-agent cap is the value that removes the bound. Written as `if (patch.x)`, both
 * would be dropped on the floor with no error anywhere, and only for the operators who
 * picked them.
