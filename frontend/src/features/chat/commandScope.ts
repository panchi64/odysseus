/** What a conversation grant on a command-running tool is scoped to, for the label and
 *  for the checkbox's own state — **presentation only**.
 *
 *  The backend derives the real scope from the parked call and is the only thing that
 *  writes one down (`services/approval_grants.py`); nothing here is sent to it. This
 *  exists because a checkbox that says "don't ask again for this tool" while the backend
 *  records "don't ask again for `uv run pytest`" is describing a decision the operator is
 *  not making. So the label names the act, and the state is keyed by that act rather than
 *  by the tool — two commands pending in one batch are two separate opt-ins, because they
 *  will be two separate grants.
 *
 *  It reads **less** than the backend's grammar walk and must never read it *differently*:
 *  a command carrying anything the shell would expand, quote or chain is unscopeable here
 *  and falls back to the plain label, which is the honest thing to say when we cannot name
 *  the act. What it does read, it reads by the backend's own three rules — an environment
 *  assignment in front of the program is not a word of the act, a flag is one of them, and
 *  the cap counts operands — because a label derived by a *different* rule is not a vaguer
 *  description of the recorded grant, it is a description of something else. `CI=1 bun
 *  test` was the case that proved it: read here as its own act, recorded there as `bun
 *  test`, and keyed as neither.
 *
 *  It cannot promise the grant will exist. The backend refuses a scope for reasons no
 *  reading of the words can see — a path leaving the worktree, a wider declared reach —
 *  and says so on the approve response, which is where that is reported (`stream/
 *  approvals.ts`). This file names the act; it does not vouch for it.
