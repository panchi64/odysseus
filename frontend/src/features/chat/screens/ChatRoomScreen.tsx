            composer's own top edge still doing the separating with light.
            **No top padding**: the fade reaches up over the transcript's last band
            on its own, and the transcript keeps exactly that band as its bottom
            inset, so the last turn at rest clears it. A pad here would add a strip

            a pair left hanging past it), and then leave a little air — at `pb-2` the
