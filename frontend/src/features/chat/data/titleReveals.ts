/**
 * Auto-title reveals.
 *
 * When the backend names a fresh thread it streams `conversation.titled` on the run. The
 * title is also persisted (the session list picks it up on the next refresh), but the
 * operator never asked for it — so the UI *types it out* rather than snapping it in. The
 * freshly-named title is held here, keyed by conversation id; the header and its sidebar
 * row reveal it with the typewriter.
 *
 * The reveal's lifetime is owned here, in the data layer — not by a mounted component's
 * animation-done callback. `revealTitle` schedules the clear up front, so an entry can
 * never leak if the operator navigates away mid-reveal, and either surface can render it
 * without one having to tell the other when it's done.
