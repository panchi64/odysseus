/**
 * A thread's sub-agents — the cards, and the transcript behind one.
 *
 * Two reads, and only one of them is about sub-agents at all. The list is this feature's
 * own; a sub-agent's transcript is just a conversation's messages, fetched with the same
 * function the main room uses, because a sub-agent *is* a conversation. Its live tail,
 * its approval and its cancel are run routes for the same reason.
 *
 * **A read that failed is not a thread with no sub-agents**, and the difference is the
 * whole reason this returns a result rather than a list. A deployment with the feature
 * switched off genuinely has none, and neither that nor a thread that has never launched
 * one is worth a broken surface. But one dropped request is not evidence of either — read
 * as "none" it would empty a panel of working sub-agents in front of the operator, and
 * stop the poll that would have corrected it, since nothing left in the list is live.
