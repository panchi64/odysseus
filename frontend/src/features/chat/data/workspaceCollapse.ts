/**
 * Which workspace sections of the rail the operator has opened or closed.
 *
 * Modelled on the pin store beside it, and held for the same reason: this is the
 * operator's own arrangement of the list, not something the backend has an opinion
 * about, and a component that remembered it per mount would forget it on every reload.
 *
 * **Three-valued on purpose.** `undefined` means the operator has never touched this
 * section, which is different from having closed it — an untouched section is free to
 * open itself when it holds the thread you are reading, and a closed one is not. Storing
 * only "the open ones" would collapse those two into one and make an explicit close
 * indistinguishable from a default.
 *
 * Keyed by project id rather than by name: two directories can both be called
 * `frontend`, and one remembered state between them would toggle the wrong section.
