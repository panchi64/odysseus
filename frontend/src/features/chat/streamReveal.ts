/**
 * Scheduling for the answer's per-character reveal.
 *
 * Two things make this harder than "fade in the new text".
 *
 * **The DOM is rebuilt on every delta.** `Markdown streamStable` keeps settled
 * blocks but re-renders the trailing one, so any element mid-animation is
 * destroyed and replaced. Animating "whatever arrived since last time" therefore
 * truncates every fade at the next delta: a run appears dim, snaps to full
 * opacity a few frames later, and the next run starts over. So characters are
 * scheduled against **absolute wall-clock times** that survive the rebuild — on
 * re-render a character's `animation-delay` is recomputed as `start - now`,
 * negative for one already in flight, which CSS reads as "begin partway
 * through". The fade continues as if nothing happened.
 *
 * **The arrival rate varies by an order of magnitude.** A fixed per-character
 * step cannot be right for both: fast enough for 300 chars/s and the reveal is
 * invisible at 30; slow enough to see at 30 and each delta's wave is still
 * running when the next three have landed, which puts later characters ahead of
 * earlier ones and scrambles the order outright. So the step is **paced to the
 * observed interval between deltas** — one run of characters is spread over
 * roughly the time until the next run is expected. The reveal front then travels
 * at whatever speed the model is producing, and it looks the same at any of
 * them, which is the property worth having.
 *
 * Everything here is pure so it can be reasoned about (and tested) without a
 * DOM; `TurnBlocks` owns the wrapping.

 * Start times for characters `[from, to)`, staggered from `now` so the run
 * resolves left-to-right as a wave rather than as a block.
 *
 * The step is `interval / count` — the run is spread over about the time until
 * the next one is expected, so the reveal front moves at the arrival rate and
 * has just finished when more text lands. That ratio is what makes it look the
 * same whether the model is producing 30 characters a second or 300.
 *
 * A burst too large to stagger inside the interval at `STEP_MIN` has its
 * overflow resolve together, at `now`. That bounds how far the reveal can trail
 * the text that has actually arrived — the caret sits at the true end of the
 * text, so a reveal that lagged would strand it ahead of anything visible.
 *
 * **Callers must re-anchor the not-yet-started tail** rather than appending:
 * pacing changes as the rate does, and a character that has not begun is
 * invisible, so moving it is free. Appending instead would let a fast delta
 * schedule characters *before* ones already queued, which both scrambles the
 * order and breaks the non-decreasing invariant `firstLiveIndex` relies on.
