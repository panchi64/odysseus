/** How a tool call reads in the transcript.
 *
 *  The agent's tools are namespaced `category_tool` (`backend/tools/catalog.py`),
 *  which is the name the model is offered and the name the operator's tool
 *  toggles match on — but it is a *registry* name, and a transcript row is not a
 *  registry. Reading `files_read_file, path=backend/app.py` costs a beat that
 *  "Read · backend/app.py" does not, and a turn is a dozen of those rows.
 *
 *  So each tool gets three things here: the glyph for its family (so a column of
 *  rows is scannable by shape before any word is read), a short label in the
 *  interface's own voice, and — where the generic fallbacks would guess wrong —
 *  which argument actually says what the call is about and what its results are
 *  counted in.
 *
 *  **The table is a display convenience, never a gate.** A tool missing from it
 *  still renders: it falls back to its category's glyph and a humanized form of
 *  its own name. That is what keeps `external_*` connector tools — which are
 *  discovered per operator and cannot be enumerated here — from needing an entry,
 *  and what keeps a newly landed backend tool from rendering as a blank row. */
