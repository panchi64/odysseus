/**
 * How wide the panel is, and how much room the surfaces inside it actually have.
 *
 * Width used to live with the persisted preferences because there was one surface and one
 * number. With a set of them it becomes layout arithmetic — a floor derived from what is
 * open, a measured box the splitting policy consults — and none of that is a preference.
 *
 * **One stored width, still.** The panel briefly had two (a document's and the agent
 * browser's) and that was collapsed when the browser moved to a window of its own; this
 * does not bring it back. One panel, one width the operator drags, and the open set
 * contributes a *floor* rather than a remembered number of its own. A per-surface map
 * would mean the panel changing size as surfaces come and go, which is the panel moving
 * under the operator rather than for them.
 *
 * **The floor is derived, the widen is a one-shot.** A surface arriving into a panel too
 * narrow for it widens the panel once, to its resting width; after that the operator's
 * drag is the only thing that moves it. Sticky widening would mean a surface opened and
 * closed repeatedly ratcheting the panel wider each time.
