/**
 * What each surface has, and what it should do about getting it.
 *
 * One module, because the alternative is a `switch` on the surface id wherever the
 * question is asked — the header bar asks availability to decide which buttons exist, the
 * panel asks it to decide whether it is worth being open, and the arrival effect asks
 * whether a surface has earned the right to put itself on screen. Three dispatches drift;
 * one does not.
 *
 * **A source reads signals the room already has.** It is handed accessors rather than
 * reaching for a store, and it may not open a fetch of its own: a surface nobody has
 * opened still has its availability evaluated on every render, so a source that polled
 * would make a closed panel cost network. Where a surface's data genuinely needs fetching
 * — the worktree diff — the fetch belongs to whoever already owns it and arrives here as
 * an accessor like the rest.
 *
 * Keyed by `SurfaceId`, so a surface added to the registry without a source is a compile
 * error rather than a button that never appears.
