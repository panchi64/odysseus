/** What each surface has, and whether it may interrupt.
 *
 *  Availability is the cheap half and still worth pinning: it decides which header
 *  buttons exist, so a source that answers wrongly either hides a surface the operator
 *  has content for or offers one that opens onto nothing.
 *
 *  **Arrival is the half with a judgement in it.** The rule is that a plan puts itself on
 *  screen while it is waiting on the operator's answer and otherwise only badges — which
 *  depends on the moment rather than on what kind of surface a plan is. That is the whole
 *  reason arrival is a predicate, and these are the cases that would make a static field
 *  wrong.
 *
 *  It used to be inferred from the thread's permission level, which needed a guard
 *  against the not-yet-loaded stand-in (the stand-in *is* `plan`). The plan now carries
 *  its own status, so the inference and its guard are both gone — and the tests for them
 *  with it.
