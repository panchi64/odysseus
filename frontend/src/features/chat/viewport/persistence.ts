/**
 * The viewport's own persisted state — presentation-only localStorage seams the panel and
 * its controls read and write. Nothing here is authoritative: it is the operator's
 * last-seen arrangement and reading preferences, never a business decision.
 *
 * **The layout is the open state.** v3 stored an `open` boolean beside the pinned
 * version, which was enough when the panel held one thing and "open" meant "showing it".
 * A panel that holds a set needs to remember *which* set, and once it does, `open` is a
 * second source of truth for something the layout already answers — and one that makes
 * "open with nothing in it" reachable. So openness is derived, and `lastLayout` is what
 * the toggle restores, because a panel that reopens empty has forgotten the thing the
 * operator was looking at.
 *
 * **What belongs to a surface now lives with it.** `pinnedKey`, `activeTab` and the seen
 * pointer were top-level fields only because there was one surface to own them. They are
 * the View's, and they move into its own bag; `fontStep` and `softWrap` stay shared,
 * because text set larger in one pane and not its neighbour reads as a bug rather than a
 * preference.
 *
 * Width is not here: it stopped being a preference the moment it became arithmetic over
 * the open set, and lives in `viewportWidth.ts`.
 *
 * **Reading is total, and never writes.** The record is JSON in localStorage, so it can
 * be absent, stale, hand-edited or written by a version that knew different surfaces.
 * Every read validates and prunes — an unknown surface id is dropped rather than handed
 * to a renderer that does not exist. Seeding from v3 follows the discipline v3 itself
 * kept with v2: the older key is read and never rewritten, so rolling back loses nothing.
