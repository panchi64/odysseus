/**
 * Every source a research thread touched, folded into one inventory.
 *
 * Derived from the transcript's own `citations`, exactly as `commandItems.ts` derives the
 * command log from its terminal blocks — and for the same reason. The fold and the cold
 * read both already produce the citations per turn, so a second fetch would be a second
 * answer to "what did this thread read", and the one that disagreed would be this one.
 * Presentation-only, and therefore thread-scoped without doing anything to be.
 *
 * **A turn's Sources row answers a different question from this panel.** That row is the
 * three-or-so links *this answer* leaned on, numbered within the turn. This is the whole
 * inventory, across every turn, which is the requirement it exists for: "a complete source
 * inventory, not the first three links". So the panel deliberately **does not number**.
 * Two numbering systems over one set of sources is worse than none — `[3]` in the
 * transcript and `[17]` here would be the same page, and an operator who noticed would be
 * right to stop trusting both.
 *
 * **Folding is the backend's rule, applied twice.** `stream/fold.ts` already folds by
 * `key` within a turn, keeping the highest `engagement`; a source read in turn 2 and
 * listed again in turn 7 is one source, so the same rule runs again across turns. It is
 * the same ladder (`ENGAGEMENT_ORDER`, mirrored from `core/citations`) rather than a
 * second opinion about which sighting is the stronger one.
