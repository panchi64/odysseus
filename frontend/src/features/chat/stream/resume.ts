/**
 * Reconciling the optimistic transcript with what the backend actually persisted.
 *
 * Four moments need it and they are all the same move: read the conversation's detail,
 * and act on what came back. What differs is only *what* they do with it — adopt the
 * server's ids onto a turn that just finished, re-attach to a run that turned out to be
 * live, or reseat wholesale after a decision was made somewhere else.
 *
 * **The guard is why they live together.** Every one of these has an `await` in the
 * middle of it, and the store it writes into belongs to whatever thread is open when the
 * answer arrives — not to the one that was open when the request went out. Reseating one
 * thread's history over another's is not a cosmetic slip: it replaces the transcript of
 * a turn that is still streaming and freezes it. Written per caller, that guard came out
 * three slightly different ways and was missing from the fourth. Written once, it is the
 * only way to get at a detail at all.
