/**
 * Settling the calls a run parked on — the permissions it needs and the questions it
 * asked.
 *
 * A parked run is waiting on the operator, and it resumes only when one body covers
 * *every* call it stopped for — which is why nothing here submits one call at a time, and
 * why approvals and answers go in the same POST rather than in two. A turn can stop for
 * both reasons at once, and it resumes once; two submissions would mean the second
 * arriving at a run that had already moved on.
 *
 * Each surface (the dock over the composer, the host-command terminal) gathers its whole
 * set and posts it as a batch; the open stream carries the results back, and the
 * optimistic patch exists only so the dock clears on the click rather than a round trip
 * later.
 *
 * **A decision can be lost, and losing one is not a failure to retry.** The same run can
 * be decided from a second tab, or by a retried request that lands after the run has
 * already resumed — the backend answers 409, and resubmitting would 409 forever. So a
 * lost race marks the cards *stale* (visible, inert, explained) and refetches the thread,
 * while an ordinary transport failure leaves them interactive. Those two error paths
 * looking alike is exactly what makes them worth stating apart.
 *
 * **Whether anything is parked is read off the blocks, not tracked beside them.** The
 * transcript already knows; a second flag kept in step with it would be a second answer to
 * the same question, and the one that goes stale is always the flag.
