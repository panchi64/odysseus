/**
 * Whether the room is waiting on the operator — read off the blocks rather than tracked
 * beside them, which is the point of the memo and the thing worth pinning.
 *
 * It drives the nav rail's warn tone and the favicon tint from any screen, so both
 * directions are load-bearing: missing a park leaves a run stalled with nothing on
 * screen saying so, and a flag that fails to clear leaves the whole shell claiming a
 * decision is owed forever. The subtle half is *which* turn it reads: a park is by
 * definition the live turn waiting, so a pending-looking block on an older turn — a
 * card left stale by a decision made in another tab — must not answer for it.
