/**
 * What the operator can do to a turn that has already been recorded.
 *
 * Regenerate, edit, cycle versions, rewind, compact, delete, pin, bookmark a snapshot —
 * all of them act on the *conversation tree* rather than on the run in flight, which is
 * why they live apart from the controller that drives a run. Each is a thin relay to a
 * live endpoint, and each ends the same way: the backend returns the new active path and
 * the store is reseated from it, so what the transcript shows after the action is exactly
 * what a cold read would give.
 *
 * **Reseat, don't patch.** The two ops that stream (regenerate/edit) optimistically reset
 * the path *before* the run so the operator sees the turn clear immediately; the rest wait
 * for the backend's answer. Neither tries to compute the resulting tree locally — a second
 * implementation of the branch arithmetic is exactly the kind of thing that agrees with the
 * backend until the day it doesn't.
 *
 * **Cancel first, then mutate.** A live fold keeps patching the message it was streaming
 * into, so an op that replaces the store while a run is open would leave the fold writing
 * to a message that no longer exists. Every reseating op therefore stops the run first.
