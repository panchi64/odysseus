/** A submitted plan, on its way to and from the operator.
 *
 *  Two seams, and both are easy to get wrong in a way nothing visible catches.
 *
 *  **The split.** A plan is answered in the Plan panel rather than the dock, so it comes
 *  off the park separately — but it is still the *same* park and the same single resume,
 *  so it must not vanish from the batch or be counted twice.
 *
 *  **The third answer.** "Revise" and "deny" both stop the call and differ only in what
 *  the model is told. A model handed the wrong one wastes the turn: a denial read as
 *  "try again" produces a second attempt at something already refused, and a revision
 *  request read as a flat no produces an apology and a stop.
