/**
 * One SSE event, applied to the transcript.
 *
 * This is the whole of the live-to-store translation, and it is deliberately the only
 * thing in this file. The controller around it owns the *run* — opening the reader,
 * cancelling, reattaching, persisting — and none of that belongs in a switch whose single
 * question is "what does this frame change on screen". Splitting them means a new event
 * type is a case here and nothing else, and a change to how a run is driven never risks
 * touching how a delta lands.
 *
 * **Three invariants everything below depends on.**
 *
 * *Idempotence.* A reattach replays a run's buffer from an earlier seq, so events arrive
 * that were already applied — sometimes over a transcript that was cold-loaded with them
 * baked in. `seq` is monotonic per run, so the high-water mark drops the overlap; where a
 * frame can also arrive over a *persisted* row (the compaction divider, a snapshot chip, a
 * steering bubble) it is additionally deduped on its own durable id.
 *
 * *One fold target, which can move.* Events land on the assistant bubble the drive opened,
 * until a `message.injected` boundary closes it and opens a fresh one — mirroring how the
 * backend persists a steered turn as segments around the injected user message, so the
 * live transcript and a reload agree about the shape of the turn.
 *
 * *Conversation-scoped things are not message blocks.* The plan, the snapshot list and the
 * window meter outlive the run that announced them; folding them onto a message would
 * strand a plan on the turn that happened to create it, the next time the transcript
 * replays.
