/**
 * Pointing the stream at a different thread.
 *
 * One effect, and everything it has to get right is about a *transition* rather than about
 * any thread in particular: what the previous thread leaves behind, what the new one is
 * seeded from, and which of the two a late answer belongs to. That is a different question
 * from driving a run or sending a turn, and it went wrong in three separate ways while it
 * was a paragraph inside the controller.
 *
 * **The live store is authoritative for the thread already open.** A turn's messages are
 * persisted only when it finishes, so a refetch mid-stream reads an *empty* conversation.
 * Re-seeding from that would blank a streaming thread, so a source change for the thread
 * we are already on is ignored outright — which also spares the freshly-created thread an
 * empty flash while its history loads, and keeps the live-only fields (preview, artifacts,
 * runId) the cold projection does not carry.
 *
 * **A null key is not "the same thread with no id".** Solid retains a resource's last
 * value once its source goes null, so the `source` arriving alongside a null key is the
 * history of the thread just *left* — seeding from it puts a deleted or abandoned
 * conversation back on screen. A null key always starts empty.
 *
 * **The backfill races the stream and must lose.** Opening a thread mid-turn fires a plan
 * read against state the run is still mutating; the fetch answers with what was true
 * before. So it re-checks that the operator is still on the thread it asked about *and*
 * that the stream has not already said something newer — otherwise the slower answer wins
 * and the panel is stale until a mutation that may never come.
