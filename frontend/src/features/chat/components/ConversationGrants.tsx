/** The conversation's active auto-approval grants — what the operator allowed to
 *  skip the per-call approval prompt for the rest of this thread, each named by the act it
 *  covers (a command where the tool runs one, else the tool). Renders nothing when
 *  there are none, and carries no band of its own: it is one row of the conversation's
 *  stats panel, which owns the layout.
 *
 *  **It lives behind Stats, not on the row under the composer.** It was a count on that
 *  line with the chips one popover further away, and before that a run of chips inline —
 *  the widest thing the old status band carried. Either way it was a per-thread setting
 *  parked among the glance items, and the line it sat in is now kept for what changes
 *  turn to turn. In the panel the operator has already opened, the chips can sit in the
 *  open: that *is* the place you go when "am I still auto-approving anything?" matters.
 *
 *  Refetches when the thread changes or the `revalidate` accessor ticks (e.g. a grant
 *  was just recorded). */
