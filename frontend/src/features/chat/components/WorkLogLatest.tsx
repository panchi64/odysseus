/** The collapsed work log's latest step, hung off the header by an elbow.
 *
 *  The header says *why* the run is doing what it does (the model's narration);
 *  this row says *what* it last did. It is an ordinary `ProcessRow` with nothing
 *  to open, so it speaks the rows' own `glyph · Label · detail` anatomy and keeps
 *  their truncation rules by construction rather than by copy. Splitting reason
 *  from act is what lets each be read at a glance: a single line carrying both
 *  truncated the reason, which is the half worth reading.
 *
 *  It only exists while the log is shut. Open, the same step is the last row of
 *  the list, and a second copy of it directly above the first would be noise.
 *
 *  **While the run streams, it arrives by tracing in** (`.ody-trace-*`, §8): its
 *  branch draws itself down and across, and the row resolves as the stroke reaches
 *  it. The caller keys it on the step's block id, so each step the run folds in
 *  replays the arrival — the fold's proof of life — while a re-render of the same
 *  step does not. The socket blips the info tone as the trace reaches it and snaps
 *  back (`.ody-trace-pin`, stepped — the machine register). A settled run shows
 *  the row still: nothing is arriving.
 *
 *  It is the first branch on the log's trunk, and the last unless pinned rows
 *  hang beneath it, so the caller says which (`edge`). */
