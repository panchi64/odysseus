/**
 * **What the agent asked, and what it was told** — the settled half of the dock, kept in
 * the transcript.
 *
 * It exists because the answer used to leave no readable trace. The question is asked in
 * a dock that takes over the composer and disappears the moment it is submitted, and the
 * only record afterwards was the `ask_user` call's own result: prose, rendered as a
 * generic tool row, inside a work log that folds shut. So a thread would read as the
 * agent asking nothing and then acting on something — the operator's own contribution to
 * the turn, missing from the account of it.
 *
 * **It is the agent's row, not the operator's.** Rendering the answers as a user bubble
 * was the obvious alternative and is worse: it would credit the operator with a message
 * they never typed, sitting in a transcript where every other user bubble is one they
 * did, and a reload would have to synthesise the same fiction to agree with itself.
 * What actually happened is that a call the agent made came back carrying their answer,
 * so it renders where that call is.
 *
 * **The question's own words come from the backend**, paired with the reply from the
 * parked call's arguments (warm, on `question.answered`; cold, from the same pairing in
 * the conversation projection). This component restates rather than re-derives, so a
 * reload cannot word a question differently from the way it was asked.
 *
 * ── Why it is a ruled band and not a card ──
 * It is a **record of N entries with one shape**, which is the case design §7 keeps a
 * border for and §10.3 gives square corners: the hairlines rule one question off the
 * next and align every answer down a single gutter, which is structural work neither
 * space nor surface value can do here. Shadow is deliberately absent — a grid is not a
 * layer (§6.4). The first version was a rounded, sunken card whose four lines were all
 * one size, so it read as a paragraph of alternating greys with no way in.
 *
 * ── The ladder, which is the whole point ──
 * Four steps, in the order §4 asks for them (size → weight → brightness):
 * the band's header and the row indices are `meta`/`micro` **mono** because they are
 * machine labels; the question is a sans `label`, dim, because that is literally what it
 * is (§10.1 — a label over its value); the answer is the **value**, and it takes the
 * transcript's reading scale rather than the chrome scale, because these are the
 * operator's own words sitting inches from the model's prose — the same argument that
 * puts `UserTurn` on `reading`; anything they wrote *beside* a choice drops back to
 * `body`, subordinate to the choice it qualifies.
