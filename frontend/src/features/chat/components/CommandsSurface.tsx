/**
 * Everything a code thread has run, as one readout.

 * place to *watch* one — but it is the wrong place to answer the question this panel
 * exists for: **what has this thread done to my machine, and did any of it fail?** In
 * the transcript a command is separated from the one before it by a turn of reasoning
 * and half a screen of prose, so a failure eight commands back is found by scrolling
 * and remembering. Here the same commands are one column, and the failures are the rows
 * that are already open.
 *
 * **Failed commands rest open; everything else rests shut.** A successful command's
 * output is a record — kept, and read later if at all — while a failed one's output is
 * the whole reason the operator came to this panel, and putting it one click away is
 * putting it behind a click nobody knows to make. The same rule the inline tool card
 * has always followed, applied to a surface whose whole content is commands.
 *
 * Deliberately **read-only**: there is nothing to press here. Approving a command is
 * answered in the dock that takes the composer's slot, where it cannot scroll out of
 * reach; a panel offering a second APPROVE would be a second place to answer one
 * question, and the two would disagree the moment one of them was stale.
