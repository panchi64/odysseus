/** The last model request on its own, under the window breakdown it belongs to.

 *  **Why it sits here and not on the composer's readout line.** Everything on that line
 *  is cumulative over the thread, which is the right frame for "what has this cost" and
 *  the wrong one for the two questions this answers. Which endpoint served the last
 *  request is invisible in a sum — a fallback chain's second model disappears into the
 *  same total as the first — and a cache that missed on this turn disappears into a
 *  hit ratio averaged over forty. Both are per-request facts, and the popover is where
 *  the operator is already looking at one request's worth of measurement.
 *
 *  **Absent, never zero**, like everything else in this readout: a null is the provider
 *  declining to say, and most OpenAI-compatible and local endpoints decline on caching
 *  entirely. A row of zeroes would read as "your caching is broken" rather than "nobody
 *  said", so a figure that wasn't reported simply isn't drawn — and when none of them
 *  were, the whole block goes with them and only the route remains. */
