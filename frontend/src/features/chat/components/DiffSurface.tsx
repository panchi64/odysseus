/**
 * What a code thread has changed, and the two ways it ends.
 *
 * This was a modal over a raw `<pre>`, opened from the header chip. Two things were
 * wrong with that. A patch is something you read *against* the conversation that
 * produced it — a dialog covers the very transcript you are checking it against — and
 * a unified diff rendered as preformatted text is the one thing in the product with a
 * purpose-built renderer sitting unused three files away.
 *
 * **MERGE is the operator's approval.** It is the only action in the product that
 * writes their own checkout, which is exactly why it is a button they press and not a
 * tool the agent can call: everything the agent does stays on a branch they can throw
 * away, and the one step off that branch is theirs. Moving the patch into a pane does
 * not move that decision — the buttons come with it.
 *
 * **The triage is the backend's ruling, rendered.** A fourteen-file diff read top to
 * bottom is fourteen files in git's order, which is alphabetical and therefore says
 * nothing about which of them can hurt. The backend now ships each file's category,
 * its risk band and a phrase saying why, already sorted — and this surface's whole
 * contract is to render that order and that verdict **verbatim**. It never sorts, never
 * re-bands, and never infers a category from a path. The one thing it derives is where
 * to draw a separator, and it derives that from two adjacent rows disagreeing about a
 * risk the server assigned — a rule about the list it was handed, not a second opinion
 * on its contents.
 */

/* Every map below is keyed by plain `string` and falls back, although the seam
 * types these three fields as closed unions. The union is the frontend's read of
 * a wire field, not a guarantee about it: a backend that grows an eighth category
 * would otherwise render a blank cell, and a blank cell beside a file the server
 * flagged is the worst possible failure for this surface. An unrecognized value
 * shows its own slug instead. */

/** Ordered high → elevated → normal, which is the order the server sends rows
 *  in. `normal` names no band of its own — the run it heads is the residue, and
 *  captioning it "normal risk" spends a heading saying nothing. A risk the
 *  server grows later still gets one, so an unknown verdict stays visible. */
