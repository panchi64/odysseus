 * never touched by the thread at all and the changed ones are the minority worth
 * marking. The two also disagree about what "no files" means: an empty snapshot is a
 * snapshot of nothing, an empty worktree usually means there is no worktree yet.
 *
 * **The markers come from the branch, so they are suppressed unless the branch is what
 * answered.** When `root` is `"project"` the listing fell back to the operator's own
 * checkout, and painting this thread's changes over it would be showing one tree's edits
 * on another tree's files — the panel says which tree it is reading instead.
