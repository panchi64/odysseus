/**
 * What a code thread has changed, as a readout you can open.
 *
 * A sandbox thread renders nothing here — the branch read answers 404 for one, which is
 * the ordinary case and not an error.
 *
 * **It no longer owns the patch.** The chip used to fetch the branch itself and show the
 * diff in a modal over a raw `<pre>`. Both were wrong once the panel could hold a diff:
 * a patch is read *against* the conversation that produced it, and a dialog covers the
 * very transcript you are checking it against. So the chip is what it always looked
 * like — a diffstat — and pressing it opens the Changes surface beside the thread. The
 * merge and discard buttons went with the patch, because they are decisions about the
 * thing you are looking at.
 *
 * The fetch moved out too (`branchState.ts`), since the surface and the chip are two
 * views of one answer.
 *
 * **It also reports staleness, and staleness is the one thing here that is a warning.**
 * A diffstat says what this thread wrote; `behind` says how far the base has moved
 * underneath it since — which is what decides whether the MERGE button at the end of
 * the Changes surface lands cleanly or opens a conflict. It is the only figure on this
 * chip that spends an accent, and it spends one because it is the only one that is
 * about to cost the operator something. Everything else stays in the button's own grey.
 *
 * Reported on `behind > 0`, never on presence: the backend sends 0 both for "level with
 * the base" and for "could not tell", and neither is a thing to warn about.
