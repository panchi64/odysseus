/**
 * A selectable session row with its own actions menu.
 *
 * **Two ways into one menu.** A right-click anywhere on the row opens it at the cursor;
 * the "···" opens the same menu against the button. Right-click is the faster gesture
 * and the one a list invites, but it is invisible and unreachable from a keyboard, so
 * the button is what makes the actions discoverable and operable. Neither alone is the
 * whole control.
 *
 * The row used to carry a pin toggle and a `3D AGO` stamp. Pinning moved into the menu
 * and the stamp into the heading above the run — it answered "when" once per row, in a
 * column the eye had to visit for all of them, to separate threads mostly from the same
 * week. What is left of the pin is a **marker, not a control**: in a sandbox mode the
 * `Pinned` heading already says it, but a code thread is filed under its directory and
 * would otherwise float to the top of its section for no visible reason.
 *
 * The label and the "···" are sibling buttons (not nested) so neither swallows the
 * other's click.
 *
 * A thread whose run is live lights its leading edge, and the light falls
 * *inward* — across the row, under the title — so the row itself reads as the
 * thing that is running rather than as a row wearing a coloured border. Every
 * row reserves the rule (transparent at rest) so lighting one can't shift the
 * list.
 *
 * **A finished run is no longer indistinguishable from a thread that never ran.** The
 * row reports two backend facts through one table (`runState.ts`), and it reports them
 * with two different devices on purpose:
 *
 * - **The edge is for what needs you.** Live work, and the two endings that mean the
 *   operator is wanted — a failure and a limit — light it. Lighting it for every
 *   `done` was the obvious version and the wrong one: §5 rule 1 is that a screen at
 *   rest is grayscale, and a rail where thirty finished threads each glow green is a
 *   rail nobody scans for the lit one. That is the whole mechanism, spent.
 * - **The dot is for what happened.** Every terminal outcome gets a 6px `StatusDot` at
 *   rest, which is exactly the trade `StatusFlag` documents: confining the hue to a
 *   mark keeps the state legible from across the room and keeps the accent budget
 *   intact. It shows only when nothing is live, since a live run is already speaking.
 *
 * Self-limiting by construction, which is what makes it bearable at all: the backend's
 * run registry is bounded, so only recently-active threads carry an outcome and the
 * older rail stays grey without the interface having to ration it.

            **It is anchored on `updated_at`, and that is an approximation the backend

            on a fresh send and drifts on a thread the run has since written to. So it

            "how long has this been going", and it is never shown at rest, where the
