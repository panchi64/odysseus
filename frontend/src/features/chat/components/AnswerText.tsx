  /* Latched, and this is what stops the screen flashing when a run finishes.
     `Markdown` renders a *different element* for `streamStable` than for its
     default path — it has to, since Solid's `innerHTML` prop can't coexist with
     rendered children on one node. Passing `live()` straight through therefore
     flipped that flag at the exact moment the answer completed, and Solid tore
     down the entire rendered answer and rebuilt it: a full re-parse, a fresh
     DOM, KaTeX re-rendered, every `pre` and `table` re-wrapped. On a long answer
     that is a visible flash at the worst possible moment — the instant the
     operator starts reading.

     Once a passage has streamed it keeps the block path forever. The two paths
     render the same content (the block path exists to replicate the prose
     cascade at the block-wrapper level), so there is nothing to switch back
     for. A message that never streamed — history, a settled turn — never takes
     the block path at all, which is the cheaper read for a long transcript. */
