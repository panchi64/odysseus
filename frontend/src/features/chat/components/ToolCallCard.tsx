/** The family glyph carries the call's state as well as its kind, so a column of

 *
 *  This is now one of only two things that report a running call — the other is
 *  the lit trunk beside it. A single call used to say "running" five ways at once:
 *  the turn's tempo line, the rail's light (the trunk's now), this glyph, a RUNNING
 *  flag at the far right, and a throbber in the middle of the row. Five dialects of one fact is
 *  what made a turn read as a console dump, and it spent the accent budget (§5)
 *  on the most ambient state there is. */

 *
 *  Six characters, not five: `num(s, 2)` plus the `S` suffix is `0.38S` for a fast
 *  call but `12.34S` for anything over ten seconds, and a shell command or a
 *  research call is routinely over ten seconds. Reserving five put the shift back
 *  exactly where the reservation was supposed to remove it. (A call over 100s
 *  still gains a character; at that point the operator has not had a pointer
 *  resting on the row for two minutes.) */

/** Inline record of a single tool invocation inside an assistant message.

 *  The collapsed row is `glyph · Label · what it was about · what came back` —
 *  the namespaced registry name (`files_read_file`) and the full argument dump
 *  move into the expanded body, where an operator who wants them is already
 *  looking. A turn is a dozen of these rows, and the row has to be scannable
 *  without being read.
 *
 *  **Only failure gets a word.** `StatusFlag` renders for `error` and nothing
 *  else. §10.5 gives warn/alert the accent on the label precisely because those
 *  are the two states that must interrupt; OK and Running are ambient, already
 *  said by the glyph and the trunk, and a row that announces its own success on
 *  every line is a row that has stopped meaning anything. Colour is never the
 *  sole carrier of the failure either (§12) — the word "Failed" is there beside
 *  the alert-toned glyph.
 *
 *  `open` makes expand/collapse controlled (expand-all/collapse-all); when
 *  undefined the card keeps its default behavior (auto-open on error).
 *
 *  **A script's calls are this same row, nested.** A `run_code` card lists the calls
 *  its script made under its own row, each with the anatomy every call has — only the
 *  place differs: `variant="nested"` hangs them off the script's own socket, a trunk of
 *  their own inside the log's, so the line says whose call each is. They list outside
 *  the disclosure, like a screenshot, because what the script did is the point of the
 *  card; the script itself is behind it, where the argument dump is for other tools. */
