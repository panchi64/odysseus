/** Where in the request a block landed, in the operator's words.
 *
 *  Worth a word on the row because the two placements cost differently and the operator
 *  can act on the difference: a block at the head is re-sent ahead of the whole history
 *  every turn, so churn there invalidates the inference engine's prompt-prefix cache from
 *  byte 0; one at the tail leaves that prefix byte-stable. */

/** One block of context the chassis put in front of the model — a project's instruction
 *  files, the skill catalog, the plan reminder, the date.
 *
 *  **It shares the rail's anatomy and refuses its card.** Every other row in a turn is
 *  something the model *did*, and those sit on a raised `bg-surface` panel because a call
 *  is a claim on attention. This is the opposite kind of fact: nobody in the conversation
 *  wrote it and the model did not ask for it — we put it there. So it keeps `ProcessRow`
 *  (the column only reads as one sequence if its rows share an anatomy, §7) and drops the
 *  surface, sitting flat on the page the way the work log's own header does. Glyph, tone
 *  and the absence of a card all say the same thing at a glance, which is what the
 *  separation has to survive on: an operator scanning a turn should never have to read a
 *  row to know whether the model or the chassis is speaking.
 *
 *  The trailing figure is the block's **token cost**, in the slot a tool call spends on
 *  elapsed time — the honest analogue, since what an injection costs is window and what a
 *  call costs is seconds. `~` because it is the same coarse estimate the context gauge
 *  renders, deliberately measured the same way so the two agree.
 *
 *  `open` makes expand/collapse controlled (expand-all/collapse-all); undefined leaves the
 *  card closed, which is where an injection belongs at rest — it is the frame around the
 *  work, not the work. */
