/** One row of the agent's process: `chevron · glyph · Label · …` with an optional
 *  cluster pinned right — or, inside a work log (`SchematicContext`),
 *  `[glyph] LABEL · … chevron`, with the chevron moved to make room for the elbow.
 *
 *  Every kind of work in a turn renders through this — a tool call, a settled
 *  reasoning trace, the work log's own header — because they sit in one column on
 *  one trunk and a column only reads as a sequence if its rows share an anatomy.
 *  They used to be three separate idioms: the tool row had a glyph, a detail and
 *  a right cluster; the reasoning accordion had a bare chevron and a word; the
 *  work log header had a shouted uppercase string. Three species in one column is
 *  why the turn read as a log rather than as the agent narrating its work.
 *
 *  The truncation rules here are the load-bearing part and are easy to lose.
 *
 *  Every segment carries `truncate`, because `overflow:hidden` is what lets a flex
 *  item shrink below its content at all — without it the row does not truncate, it
 *  overflows, and a `shrink-0` segment inside this `min-w-0 flex-1` button escapes
 *  the button's box and paints over the cluster to its right.
 *
 *  **The label is the exception, and it is bounded rather than pinned.** Leaving it
 *  to plain flex was the old rule, on the theory that flex shrinks the longest
 *  segment hardest so the shortest survives. It does not survive: at 375px a row
 *  read `R… · backend/ap… · 412 li…`, and the *label* is the one segment that must
 *  not go — glyph plus label is how a column of rows is parsed before a word of
 *  detail is read. So it takes `shrink-0` to opt out of the squeeze, and
 *  `max-w-2/5` so a long label ("Host command", a humanized `external_*` name)
 *  still cannot run past its share and out of the box. The detail beside it absorbs
 *  the loss instead, which is the right place for it: a truncated path is still
 *  recognizable, a truncated verb is not.
 *
 *  **The trailing cluster is capped at half the row and wraps inside that half.** It
 *  used to be `shrink-0`, so in a narrow pane three flags took the whole row and the
 *  detail — the command, the topic — truncated to nothing. The flags wrap onto a second
 *  line instead, and the half they leave is the floor the label and detail read in. */
