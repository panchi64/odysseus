 * **Which kind of work you are looking at** — the rail's first control, above the
 * threads it arranges.
 *
 * It used to be a dropdown in the composer, shown only while a thread was still
 * unsaved, because the mode was a property of the message being sent. It is not:
 * it is a property of the *thread*, and therefore of the list of threads. Here it
 * does one thing that reads as three — it files what the rail shows, decides what
 * the next new thread will be, and repaints the signature accent through
 * `data-mode` — because those are the same fact stated at three ranges.
 *
 * The mode of a thread already saved is still immutable and still the backend's:
 * a code thread owns a git branch, and re-pointing it would strand that branch.
 * Opening one moves this switch to match it rather than the other way round.
 *
 * **It no longer asks which directory a code thread will work in.** That line lived
 * here for as long as the directory was something chosen *after* pressing NEW; now the
 * directory comes first and the thread is started from its own section of the rail, so
 * the question is asked where the answer already is. This is the mode switch and
 * nothing else.
