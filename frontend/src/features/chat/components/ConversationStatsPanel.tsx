/** What the thread has cost, and the two settings that belong to it, behind one
 *  `stats` cell in the composer's status bar.
 *
 *  **Why a panel and not the line it replaced.** These figures were a row of
 *  `micro` segments under the input, each with its meaning in a tooltip. Most turns
 *  need none of them, and all of them together were loud enough to bury the thing
 *  they sat next to — every readout individually small enough to dismiss. A trigger
 *  costs one word; the panel spends the room the line never had on saying what each
 *  number means, in a sentence rather than on hover.
 *
 *  **What the numbers count.** Everything is cumulative over the *conversation*, not
 *  the last run — the line used to report a single turn and reset at the start of the
 *  next, which meant the one moment an operator wants to know what a long thread has
 *  spent was the moment it went blank. `turns` are the operator's own exchanges and
 *  `steps` the model round-trips inside them, so the ratio is itself information.
 *
 *  **Everything unmeasured stays absent** — not zeroed. A `null` from the backend means
 *  nobody reported that figure (an endpoint that sends no cache tokens, turns recorded
 *  before the stopwatch existed), and a `0%` cache hit would read as a broken cache
 *  rather than an unreported one.
 *
 *  **The grants and auto-compaction live here too**, under "This conversation": they are
 *  per-thread settings, not glance items, and keeping them on the row would rebuild the
 *  clutter this panel exists to clear.
 *
 *  Presentation only — every value is the backend's, rendered, never derived here. The
 *  averages and rates arrive already computed for exactly that reason. */
