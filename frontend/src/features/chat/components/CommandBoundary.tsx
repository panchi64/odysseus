/**
 * What a command said it needed, and what actually held it to that.
 *
 * Two facts, and the reason they are rendered as a pair rather than as one verdict is
 * that they can disagree. `reach` is the model's own **declaration**, made on the call
 * and checked against every path the command names before anything runs; `fenced` is
 * whether an OS fence built from that declaration was applied to the process. A command
 * can declare the workspace and still run unfenced — a host with no sandbox primitive
 * has none to build — and an operator who only ever saw one of the two would be reading
 * a claim as if it were an enforcement, or an enforcement without knowing what it was
 * enforcing.
 *
 * They arrive on the **result**, at every permission level. That is what makes this a
 * per-command readout rather than a line on a review row: only the Auto level produces a
 * review, so a thread at Manual or Yolo used to run commands with neither fact anywhere
 * on screen.
 *
 * Renders nothing at all when there is no declaration — a call that never executed, or a
 * thread from before the tool carried one. An absent fact says nothing, and a placeholder
 * reading UNKNOWN would be a third state the backend never reports.
 *
 * It takes the **facts**, not a command, so the one component serves both kinds of row
 * that can hold them: a terminal, and the ordinary tool card a backgrounded command
 * renders as.
