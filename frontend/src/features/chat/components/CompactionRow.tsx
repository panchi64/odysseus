 *  fold's figures, `CompactionSummary` for each section — and neither should have to
 *  import the other to reach it.
 *
 *  Stacked rather than set in two columns, because the legends are short and the values
 *  are not — a fixed label column wide enough for "Context" leaves a summary paragraph
 *  reading in a gutter on a half-width panel. The `plate` step does the work a column
 *  would: it names a region, which is exactly what §4 keeps it for. */

   *  and a line of their own, and read better beside the thing they measure than as a
   *  separate readout the operator has to relate back to it. */
