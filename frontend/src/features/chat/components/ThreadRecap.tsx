/**
 * What this thread was, for an operator who has just come back to it.
 *
 * **It is a summary now, and it used to be a row of figures.** Mode, age, turn count
 * and the branch diffstat were all things the interface could already answer — the
 * rail says the mode, the header chip says the branch — so the band spent a strip of
 * the screen restating them and answered the actual re-entry question, *what was I
 * doing here*, not at all. That question needs prose, and prose is not something the
 * client can derive: the backend's utility model writes it once a thread has been
 * idle a while, replaces it wholesale each time, and the band renders whatever the
 * newest one says.
 *
 * **Two figures survived, and both for the same reason** — they are facts about the
 * thread that the summary cannot carry and nothing else on screen says. `OPENED` is
 * when the thread began, which is the one thing that places it among the others; the
 * last run's outcome is what says a thread ended badly, and a summary written before
 * the failure would not mention it.
 *
 * **It is a `Panel`, not a `ConsoleGroup`.** The group is for ruled rows and fixed
 * cells read by scanning, and §7 is explicit that it is not for prose — which is
 * exactly what the band now leads with. A panel is the default container and the
 * right one the moment the content became a paragraph.
 *
 * **Absent unless it has something to say.** No summary yet (the ordinary state of a
 * thread still being worked on), a thread quiet for less than `COLD_AFTER_MS`, or a
 * run in flight — in that last case the live state is the answer, and a recap of the
 * previous turn would be reporting the past over the present.
