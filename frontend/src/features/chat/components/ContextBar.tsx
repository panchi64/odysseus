 *
 *  It is **the one readout left on the bar rather than behind Stats**. Everything in
 *  the stats panel is a *tally* — what the thread has spent, counting up with no
 *  ceiling in sight. This is the one figure with a ceiling, and the ceiling is the
 *  point: the operator is not tracking how many tokens the window holds, they are
 *  watching for the moment it runs out. The track makes that a length read at a glance;
 *  the figure beside it is there for the moment a glance isn't enough.
 *
 *  **The warn tick is where this thread folds.** A 1px amber mark across the track at
 *  the backend's own fold point for *this* thread (`usage.fold` — the operator's
 *  threshold with the conversation's override already applied), drawn only while
 *  folding is armed. With it off there is nothing that will happen at that point, and a
 *  mark would promise a fold that isn't coming; the breakdown behind the click still
 *  shows where it would be. With no policy reported there is no tick at all.
 *
 *  **Click for the breakdown** (`ContextBreakdown`). The bar answers *how full*; the
 *  question it provokes is *full of what* — worth a click, because the answers lead to
 *  different actions. It opens in the View panel's own container (`RevealPopover`), so
 *  it arrives as a place made for it. */
