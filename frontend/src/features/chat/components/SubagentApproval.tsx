/**
 * A sub-agent that stopped to ask permission, answered where the operator finds it.
 *
 * Without this a blocked sub-agent is a deadlock with a spinner on it: nobody is in that
 * thread, there is nowhere to type in it, and the run waits for a decision the operator
 * has no way to give. The panel is where they learn about it, so it has to be where they
 * answer it.
 *
 * **Everything here is the existing machinery, addressed at a different run.** The
 * approval endpoint is already run-id addressed, so a sub-agent's park needs no route of
 * its own; `ApprovalPanel` is the same card the main room renders, so an approval reads
 * identically wherever it is answered — which matters, because the operator is ruling on
 * the same act either way and a second, thinner card would be one that quietly showed
 * less about it.
 *
 * **Read off the child's own stream, from the beginning.** A parked run's requests live
 * in its event log, replayed in full from seq 0 — the same replay the main room does
 * after a reload, for the same reason. That also means this needs no new backend field:
 * the fact that a sub-agent is blocked comes from the card's status, and *what* it is
 * blocked on comes from the run that is blocked.
 *
 * The stream is opened only while a blocked card is expanded, and closed with it.
