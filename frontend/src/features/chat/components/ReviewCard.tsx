 *  *model* did, and this is not. The model asked; we answered for the operator. Sitting
 *  flat on the page beside the call it judged is what says that at a glance, before a word
 *  of the row is read.
 *
 *  **A refusal is the one state that gets a flag.** A cleared call is followed by the call
 *  itself and a parked one by an approval card, so both are accounted for by the row after
 *  them. A refused call is followed by nothing at all — this row is the entire record of
 *  it, and it is the single thing in a turn an operator is most likely to disagree with.
 *
 *  `open` makes expand/collapse controlled (expand-all/collapse-all); at rest the row is
 *  closed, because the verdict is on the row and only the grounds are behind it. */
