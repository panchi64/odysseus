 *  while shut, hangs the latest step beneath it in the rows' own `glyph · Label ·
 *  detail` anatomy. See `WorkLogHeader` and `WorkLogLatest`.
 *
 *  **Some rows the fold may not hide, and they stay in place rather than outside.**
 *  A call in flight, a failure, a screenshot and a refusal are all pinned
 *  (`pinsRunInline` in `blocks.ts`), and they used to be pinned by being *ejected*
 *  from the log — which ended it and started a second one underneath with the same
 *  name. A turn with one failed call rendered as three separate items the operator
 *  had to reassemble into one sequence. The promise was only ever that such a row
 *  stays visible; it is kept here by rendering it outside the fold's collapse while
 *  leaving it where it happened.
 *
 *  That is why this walks one list and gates each row individually instead of
 *  wrapping the whole run in one `Collapse`: the fold has to be able to close
 *  around a pinned row without closing over it. */
