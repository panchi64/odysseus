 *  inside a `Collapse`, which clips, so `WorkLog` draws the short length from the
 *  chevron to the header's foot itself.
 *
 *  `nested` hangs a script's calls off the script's own socket — 8px in (half the

 *  that socket's foot. */

/** One row hung off a trunk by an elbow — the work log drawn as a schematic, every
 *  step a trace landing on a pin, the whole run one connected line (§8, §9).
 *
 *  Each branch draws its own length of trunk rather than the log drawing one line
 *  behind all of them, because only a row knows its own height: a row that opens
 *  grows, and a trunk measured once would stop short of the rows beneath it. The
 *  last branch stops its trunk at its elbow, which is what turns `├` into `└`.
 *
 *  The elbow lands at 12px — the centre of a schematic `ProcessRow` (`py-1` plus
 *  half the 16px socket), so it meets the glyph's socket edge-on. A row that is
 *  not a `ProcessRow` (a host terminal) takes the elbow on its own edge instead.
 *
 *  `lit` is the old rail's LED, kept: the running row's length of trunk is a
 *  `LedEdge`, so it emits rather than merely turning blue, and its elbow takes the
 *  same tone. `chassis` dashes the elbow — the trace for a row the chassis put
 *  there (injected context, a review) rather than one the model did, which the
 *  row's own dashed socket repeats; bare rows no longer have a card to refuse, so
 *  this is what tells the two apart at a glance. `trace` draws the strokes in
 *  (`.ody-trace-*`) — the collapsed log's latest step, as it arrives. */
