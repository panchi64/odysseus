/** What the model is left holding after a fold — one ruled row per section.
 *
 *  **Read as a readout, not as a passage.** A summary stands in for a whole stretch of a
 *  conversation, so rendered flat it is a screenful of undifferentiated prose sitting in
 *  the middle of the transcript, which is the one shape guaranteed not to be read. The
 *  summarizer is asked for eight fixed headings and the backend parses them, so the
 *  structure is already there; this sets it so the operator can *scan*: every heading
 *  engraved at once, each body clamped to a few lines, and one control on the section they
 *  actually want.
 *
 *  That is deliberately not the closed chevron this surface replaced. A chevron hid
 *  whether there was anything at all; this shows what the model remembers *about* — the
 *  decisions, the anchors, the open questions — and only the depth of each is behind a
 *  control.
 *
 *  **Mono throughout, like the panel around it** (§2): a checkpoint is machine output from
 *  end to end, and the one thing it must not read as is another contribution to the
 *  conversation.
 *
 *  Three rules decide how a section is set, and all three come off the wire rather than
 *  being guessed here:
 *
 *  - **The machine voice is for Anchors.** Its whole purpose is exact paths, ids and
 *    numbers carried across a fold character for character, so it takes the tightest mono
 *    step rather than the reading one. Every other section is prose.
 *  - **Tool-derived text is attributed, never quoted silently.** A checkpoint is replayed
 *    to the model as a user-shaped message — the most authoritative voice in the history —
 *    and one section repeats what a web page or a file said. The backend fences it for the
 *    model; the operator gets the same fact as a bordered, labelled block. The fence's
 *    *markers* stay behind: the nonce is addressed to the model and is noise here.
 *  - **A section with no heading is a checkpoint that didn't parse.** Old checkpoints and
 *    summarizer drift degrade to one keyless section holding the whole text. That is the
 *    one case where a wall of prose is the honest rendering — so it is clamped hardest and
 *    legended `Briefing`, which claims no structure for it. Not `Summary`: the panel
 *    already has a row by that name carrying the figures and the explanation, and a second
 *    one wearing the same legend reads as the first repeating itself.

/** A section's text, clamped to a few lines with the rest one control away.
 *
 *  `micro` is the tightest mono step and is where Anchors belongs — a column of exact
 *  paths and ids is read by looking *down* it, and the smaller step keeps more of it on
 *  screen at once. Everything else takes `code`, the mono step §4 keeps for content set
 *  inside chrome. Both wrap on the stored line breaks, which are load-bearing in a
 *  bulleted list.
 *
 *  **Clamped by height, and the control is measured into existence.** Most sections are a
 *  sentence or two and need none at all; a MORE that expands nothing is worse than no
 *  MORE, so the toggle appears only where the text actually overflows. An unparsed
 *  checkpoint — one keyless section holding everything — gets the tighter clamp, because
 *  it is the case that would otherwise be the whole screen.
 *
 *  **Re-measured whenever the box resizes**, not only at mount. The clamp stays applied
 *  whatever layout does next, so a section that fit when it mounted — before the mono
 *  face loaded, or at a wider panel — would otherwise be cut off later with no control
 *  to open it. Only while closed: an open section is not clamped, so it cannot tell. */
