/**
 * The workspace, browsable on its own.
 *
 * **It reads the worktree, not a snapshot of one.** It used to list the newest View
 * version's files, which meant the panel was empty — and unavailable — until the agent
 * happened to call `view_show`. A code thread that edits ten files and never captures a
 * version is an ordinary code thread, and it showed nothing. The tree now comes from the
 * same listing the composer's `@` picker reads, resolved by the backend against this
 * thread's own worktree.
 *
 * **It is not the View's CODE tab, and that tab is unchanged.** CODE compares two
 * *captured* versions and owns the pickers for choosing them; there is no live equivalent
 * of a comparison between two moments that were never recorded. This is the workspace as
 * a place you go, which is what it is.
 *
 * **What changed is the branch's word, joined here by path.** The marker on a row comes
 * from `BranchState.files`, which the backend already ranked and classified; this puts
 * two server answers beside each other and renders both verbatim. It classifies nothing.
 *
 * **Narrow, it is one thing at a time.** A tree beside a file is the right layout when
 * there is room for both and an unreadable pair when there is not, so below
 * `SIDE_BY_SIDE` picking a file replaces the list and a back control returns to it.
