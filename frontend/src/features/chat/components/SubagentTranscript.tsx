/**
 * What a sub-agent actually did — the body of its own view (`SubagentDetail`).
 *
 * **It is a conversation, so it is read as one.** `useChatSession` is the main room's
 * own loader and `TurnBlocks` its own renderer — the think → tool → text sequence, the
 * work log, the folding, all of it — so a sub-agent's transcript reads exactly like the
 * agent's own work, which is what it is. Writing a second, simpler renderer here would
 * have meant a transcript that quietly showed less than the real one.
 *
 * **`TurnBlocks`, not `MessageItem`.** That wrapper carries the main room's actions —
 * edit, fork, rewind, retry — every one of which acts on a thread the operator is in.
 * Nobody can type into a sub-agent, so those are not merely unused here, they are
 * offers that could not be honoured.
 *
 * **The opening prompt is shown, and it is not the operator's.** It is the task the
 * agent wrote, which is the first thing worth reading: a sub-agent that answered the
 * wrong question usually answered the question it was actually given.
 *
 * **No live tail.** A card that is still working shows the transcript as of the last
 * poll, with a line saying so, rather than attaching to the child's event stream. That
 * stream exists and would work — but a pane holding several would hold several open
 * connections to watch work nobody is blocked on, and the panel already refreshes while
 * anything is live.
 *
 * **Which is what re-reads this.** The card's own figures are the signal: `contextUsed`
 * only moves when the sub-agent has actually made another model request, so keying the
 * read on it re-fetches when there is new transcript to see and never on a poll that
 * found nothing new. A finished sub-agent's figures stop moving, so its transcript is
 * read once and then left alone, which is the whole reason opening one is cheap.
 *
 * **No inset of its own.** It used to sit under a card with a rule down its left edge
 * saying "this belongs to that". It is now the pane's whole content, and a border
 * marking a relationship to something no longer on screen is a line with nothing to say.
