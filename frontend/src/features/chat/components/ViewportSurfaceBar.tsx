/**
 * One button per surface that has something to show.
 *
 * It replaces the single eye toggle, which could only say "the panel" — fine while the
 * panel held one thing, and a guess the moment it holds several. A button per surface
 * says which, and clicking it puts that surface on screen rather than restoring whatever
 * was there last.
 *
 * **Only available surfaces render.** A button for a surface with nothing behind it is a
 * button that opens onto an empty frame, and the operator learns to distrust the row. In
 * an ordinary chat thread that leaves one button or none; a code thread with a plan and a
 * diff shows three. The row is therefore usually shorter than the registry, which is what
 * keeps it from crowding a header that also carries the title, the workspace hint, the
 * branch chip and the session menu.
 *
 * `md` rather than the product's standard `sm` ghost icon, matching the session-actions
 * trigger beside it: these are the most-reached-for controls in the header and are sized
 * as peers. That was the eye's reasoning and it survives the eye.
