/**
 * The answer reveal's DOM half — wrapping characters so they resolve in, and taking the
 * wrappers back out once they have.
 *
 * The scheduling math lives in `streamReveal.ts` and is pure; this is the part that
 * touches nodes. Three rules shape all of it.
 *
 * **Only the blocks inside the reveal window are touched.** Walking the whole answer per
 * delta was O(answer) work per token for a bounded result, and it re-entered blocks that
 * had long since settled and nested a second span inside each existing one. A block
 * enters `schedules` when it starts being wrapped and leaves as soon as its last fade is
 * over, so the per-delta cost is set by the window rather than by the length of the
 * answer — but a block still in that window IS re-wrapped, because `Markdown` rebuilds it
 * out from under its wrappers on the delta that ends it. See `applyReveal`.
 *
 * **The schedule is LOCAL to that block, and this is load-bearing.** An earlier version
 * indexed one schedule across the whole answer (`base + local`, with each earlier block's
 * character count cached). That is wrong, because the animatable character space is not
 * stable: `animatableText` rejects machine-voice subtrees, so a fenced code block that
 * lexes as a paragraph while its closing fence is still missing counts N characters and
 * then counts ZERO the moment it becomes a `<pre>`. Every later character's index shifts
 * down by N, lands on schedule entries whose fades finished long ago, and `revealDelay`
 * returns `null` — which renders them as bare text with no wrapper and no animation. The
 * measured symptom was 73 characters sitting at opacity 0 vanishing in a single frame,
 * the answer snapping into place instead of resolving. Indexing within the block removes
 * the failure rather than compensating for it: nothing an earlier block does can move a
 * later block's indices, because they no longer share a space.
 *
 * **Every wrapper is taken back out.** Nothing did this originally, so every character
 * that passed through the reveal window kept its span, its inline `animation-delay` and
 * its filled animation for the life of the session — ~280 per answer, permanently. A
 * finished fade is invisible; the span it left behind is not, and a one-character span is
 * a one-character text-shaping run, paid again on every repaint of a scrolling
 * transcript. A block is unwrapped only once its last character's fade is over, so
 * unwrapping can never cut one short.

/** Subtrees the fade must not enter, because their contents are the machine's

 *  markup would be meddling with a layout we don't own. `.font-mono` catches
 *  anything that opted in by class.
 *
 *  `table` is here for three reasons that agree. A table is a dense data panel
 *  (§10) whose header band is already mono because a column header names a
 *  machine field — and it is mono by `font-family`, not by a class, so nothing
 *  else in this list would have caught it. Its cells are emitted values, which
 *  is the §2 test for the machine voice. And the eye reads a grid in two
 *  dimensions, so a reveal sweeping left-to-right through cells reads as
 *  flicker rather than as arrival — on top of the column widths still
 *  reflowing as rows stream in.
 *
 *  `.ody-open-path` is a file the answer pointed at (markdownLinks.ts). It is
 *  mono by rule rather than by the `.font-mono` class, so nothing above catches
 *  it, and it is machine voice by the same §2 test the table is: a path is a
