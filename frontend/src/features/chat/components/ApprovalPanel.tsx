 * run resumes on one body covering all of it. `ParkDock` owns the submit; this owns the
 * approve/deny state and the grant opt-in.
 *
 * Each approval also offers an opt-in "allow for the rest of this conversation" grant
 * (off by default): when checked and approved, the backend records a grant so the same
 * act auto-approves for the rest of the conversation instead of re-prompting. The grant's
 * scope is the backend's to derive from the parked call — for a tool that runs a command
 * it is that command, not the tool — and this only asks for one.
 *
 * ── What the card shows, and what it keeps back ──
 * A name, the tool's own plain-language explanation, and **the call itself behind a
 * toggle**. The raw rendering used to be the headline, which for a submitted plan meant
 * the entire document on one line above the buttons — a wall of text nobody reads, in the
 * place the operator most needs to be reading. It is still one click away, because a
 * shell command the operator cannot see is a decision they cannot actually make; it is
 * simply no longer the first thing on the card.
 *
 * ── The plan, and why it is a branch rather than a component ──
 * A submitted plan is an approval like any other — same park, same resume, same single
 * body — that happens to be read as a document and answered with three words instead of
 * two. Everything that differs is presentation: what sits behind the toggle, whether a
 * standing grant is even a coherent thing to offer, and whether "revise" is on the table.
 * All three are read off the call's own tool name, so no caller has to remember to say so
 * and no caller can disagree with another about it.
