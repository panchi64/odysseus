 *  the `narration` the model wrote for the most recent call that had one. Two
 *  earlier headlines were tried and both reported the wrong thing: `7 Steps` and
 *  `Read ×4 · Web search · +2` reported *magnitude* where the operator reads for
 *  identity, and `Read agent.py` gave identity without intent — the question a
 *  turn read back is almost always asking is what it was *for*.
 *
 *  It also moves while the turn runs, snapping rather than easing — mono, the
 *  machine register (§8). No throbber sits here: `TurnProgressRail` is where the
 *  live phase is spoken, once.
 *
 *  The step count is the run's size, dim and pinned right where a card puts its
 *  elapsed figure — metadata, not the headline. "Is opening this worth it" is
 *  the one question a bare magnitude does answer honestly. */
