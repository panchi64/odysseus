/** Where the thread's earlier turns were folded into a summary — as a turn in the
 *  transcript, in flight and settled alike.
 *
 *  **A console group (§10.14), and the whole thing is machine voice (§2).** Nobody said
 *  this: the chassis did it *to* the model, and what the panel holds is the chassis' own
 *  record of the act — a cause, two figures, and the briefing the model now reads in place
 *  of everything above. So it is set in mono throughout, which does two jobs at once. It
 *  is the honest register for machine output, and it is what stops a checkpoint reading as
 *  one more contribution to the conversation: the fold is the one thing in the transcript
 *  that is *about* the transcript.
 *
 *  §10.14 reserves the group for readouts and warns off prose, and the exception is worth
 *  stating rather than assuming. A checkpoint is not an answer read start to finish — it
 *  is a fixed roster of eight named sections, and what the operator does with it is scan
 *  for the one they care about (*what did it keep about the decisions? the paths?*). That
 *  is the reading a ruled column is for. What the rule guards against is a frame drawn
 *  around ordinary content at the wrong density, and this is not that.
 *
 *  **One component for both states**, because they are one event and the operator watches
 *  it cross from one to the other. While the summarizer runs the panel carries a throbber
 *  and the summary as it is written; when `conversation.compacted` lands, the live turn is
 *  dropped and the settled one is seated at the fold boundary — a different place in the
 *  list, which is why the room scrolls to it rather than leaving the operator to find it.
