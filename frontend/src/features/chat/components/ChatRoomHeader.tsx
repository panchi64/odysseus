 * a control rather than a second read-only copy of one, and the run state rides the
 * composer's header line beside the run clock, where the operator is looking while it
 * matters. The thread's age answered a question nobody was asking. What is left is a
 * title that floats over the transcript scrolling beneath it.
 *
 * **The other end of the row is what the thread can show you**, and that is a different
 * kind of thing from a name: the branch chip reads out what this thread has changed and
 * opens the patch, and beside it there is a button per surface the panel has something
 * to put in. Identity on the left, ways in on the right — so the row reads as one
 * question answered and one set of doors, rather than six controls in a line.
 *
 * **It carries no fill.** The room lays it over the top of the transcript, which
 * scrolls beneath it into a `ScrollFade` — so the header is a line of type over the
 * conversation rather than a band taking its own height above it.
