/**
 * The thread's claim-level reading, fetched once for the panel that shows it.
 *
 * Unlike the source inventory and the command log — both derived from the transcript —
 * this is a separate reading the backend stores sealed and serves on its own route. It
 * is fetched rather than derived because it is genuinely not in the transcript: it is
 * what a *second* model found when it read the answer against the sources the turn
 * retained.
 *
 * **Absent is the ordinary state.** Every non-research thread has none of this, as does
 * every research answer that cited nothing, so an empty read is never an error and never
 * blanks the message-level sources the panel already shows.
 *
 * The same `.latest` discipline `branchState.ts` keeps, for the same reason: a plain read
 * goes `undefined` for the length of a refetch, and the claims would blink out of the
 * panel at exactly the moment a turn finishes and the operator looks up.
 *
 * **Everything here is tagged with the thread it is about.** This controller outlives
 * every conversation the room shows, and the pass it drives takes a model call — long
 * enough for the operator to move on. Untagged, `.latest` shows the thread they left
 * until the next read lands, a write-back lands in whichever thread is current, and one
 * boolean lights (and then clears) a button that belongs to a different conversation.
