/**
 * Does a streamed answer leave anything behind?
 *
 * The reveal wraps each arriving character in its own span so it can resolve in on its
 * own schedule, and for a long time nothing ever took those wrappers out again: every
 * character that passed through the reveal window kept its span, its inline
 * `animation-delay` and its filled animation for the life of the session. A four-turn
 * fixture left over a thousand of them. That is invisible — the fade is over, the text
 * reads correctly — and it is paid on every repaint of a scrolling transcript, both in
 * the extra elements and in text that is shaped one character at a time.
 *
 * So the assertion is the one thing no unit test can see: after a stream ends, the DOM
 * holds no reveal wrappers and the answer still reads exactly as its source. The pure
 * scheduling rules behind it are covered in `streamReveal.test.ts`; this is the check
 * that the DOM half actually runs.
 *
 * It drives `/bench` (dev-only, no auth, no backend, synthetic content) through
 * `__bench.pump()` rather than through frames, because `requestAnimationFrame` does not
 * fire in a headless WebView.
 *
 * Excluded from `bun run test`; `bun run test:smoke` runs it.
