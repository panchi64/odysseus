/** How a context contributor reads on screen — the slug the backend sends becoming a
 *  glyph and a word.
 *
 *  The sibling of `toolPresentation.ts`, and for the same reason: the backend sends a
 *  registry slug (`skill_catalog`, `repo`, `plan`) because the wording of a readout is
 *  presentation and it has no business choosing sentence case, and two surfaces then need
 *  the same slug to become the same words. The context gauge's breakdown row and the work
 *  log's injection row are one block seen from two distances; naming it "Project
 *  instructions" in one and "Repo" in the other would leave the operator working out that
 *  they are the same thing.
 *
 *  **The overrides are a short list, not a registry.** Every tool category and every
 *  instruction provider the backend grows later reads correctly from its own id, so
 *  nothing here has to be edited when a feature ships one — only the few slugs whose own
 *  words would actively mislead are named. */
