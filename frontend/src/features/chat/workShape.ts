/** What a folded run of work amounts to — the last thing it did, and how much of
 *  it there is.
 *
 *  Two summaries have been tried here and both failed for the same reason: they
 *  reported *magnitude* where the operator was reading for *identity*. `7 Steps`
 *  ranked every turn in a thread identically. `Read ×4 · Web search · Write`
 *  named the tools, which was better, but a per-tool tally is still a number
 *  without a referent — whether the agent read four files or seven changes
 *  nothing about whether this fold is worth opening, and the `+N` overflow was
 *  worse still, counting kinds the operator could not see.
 *
 *  What actually distinguishes one fold from another is **what it last did**:
 *  `Read agent.py`, `Web search "pydantic ai streaming"`. That is a fact with a
 *  noun in it. It also does the work the old summary could not do at all —
 *  while the turn streams, settled work keeps folding in, so this line advances
 *  as the run progresses and is the fold's own proof of life.
 *
 *  The size of the run rides along as dim metadata rather than as the headline,
 *  because "is opening this worth it" is the one question a magnitude genuinely
 *  answers.
 *
 *  Pure data → data, like `blocks.ts`: no Solid, no DOM, so the rules stay
 *  testable and live in one place. */
