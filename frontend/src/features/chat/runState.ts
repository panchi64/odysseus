/**
 * What state a thread's run is in, and how the interface says it — once, for every
 * surface that asks.
 *
 * **Why this is a module and not a table inside `SessionRow`.** Three surfaces report
 * the same fact: the rail's row lights its edge, the room's header flies a flag, and a
 * cold thread's recap prints it in a cell. A table per surface is three tables that
 * agree until the day one of them gains a state, and the failure is silent — the rail
 * calls a run `BLOCKED` in amber while the header three inches away still calls it
 * finished. So the mapping is derived once and passed down, per the repo's own rule.
 *
 * **The frontend decides nothing here.** Both inputs are backend-derived — `activity`
 * from the live run registry, `lastOutcome` from the last terminal run in it — and this
 * file only chooses words and a tone for them. The one rule it does encode is the
 * *precedence* the contract states: while a run is live, that is the thread's state; the
 * outcome is what it falls back to at rest.
