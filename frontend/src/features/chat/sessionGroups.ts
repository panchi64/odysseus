/**
 * How the rail arranges a mode's threads.
 *
 * The three modes do not want the same list, and the split is what there is to file
 * *under*. A Code thread has a directory, and after a fortnight of them the flat list
 * is a hundred rows whose titles all sound alike; what the operator is looking for is
 * "the threads in *this* repository", which is a heading, not a search. Normal and
 * Research threads work in their own sandbox and have no directory at all — so the
 * only heading that means anything for them is *when*.
 *
 * That second heading replaced a per-row `3D AGO` stamp, and the trade is the point:
 * the stamp answered "when" once per row, in a column the eye had to visit for every
 * one of them, to separate threads that were mostly from the same week anyway. A
 * heading answers it once for a run and then stays out of the way.
 *
 * So this is a strategy over one input rather than two list components, and the two
 * strategies produce genuinely different headings rather than one shape wearing
 * different text — see `SessionGroup`. Pure: ordering is the caller's (it reads the
 * pin store), and the pin set and the clock arrive as arguments, which is what keeps
 * this testable without a DOM or a fixed today.
