/**
 * Which tools render as a terminal, and how a command's result becomes one.
 *
 * The table is the point. The fold used to ask `name === code_run_host_command` in four
 * separate event cases, so the worktree shell — code mode's only way to run anything at
 * all — fell through to a generic tool card while carrying the terminal glyph.
 *
 * The **second** point is the object/string split. Both command tools answer with a
 * record when they execute and a plain sentence when a guard refused them, so the shape
 * of the result is what says whether anything ran — and nothing here may be keyed on a
 * tool name to work that out.
