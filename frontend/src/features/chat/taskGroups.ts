/**
 * Whose task list is whose, when a thread is not the only one working.
 *
 * A sub-agent is its own conversation, so the list it keeps for itself is its own row in
 * its own thread — nothing merges the two, and until now nothing showed the operator that
 * a delegated piece of work had a shape at all. The Tasks surface would say "3/4" while
 * four sub-agents were quietly working through lists of their own.
 *
 * **Grouped rather than merged.** Interleaving them into one list would be a list nobody
 * could act on: two agents' steps in one sequence read as one plan whose order makes no
 * sense, and a `2/7` over the top of it counts work being done in parallel as though it
 * were being done in a line. A heading per sub-agent keeps each list the thing it is.
 *
 * **The thread's own list comes first and carries no heading.** It is the answer to
 * "what is being done here", and labelling it would make it look like one delegate among
 * several rather than the work the operator asked for.
 *
 * Pure, and it takes the delegates structurally rather than as `Subagent`s: what it needs
 * is a name and a list, and a rule about how a list is read should not depend on the
 * shape of a card.
