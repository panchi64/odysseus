/** Two one-liners about a tool call: what it was *about*, and what came *back*.
 *
 *  A row that says only which tool ran tells the operator almost nothing — a turn
 *  with six `files_read_file` calls is six identical rows. The salient argument is
 *  what distinguishes them, and the result's shape is what says whether the call
 *  landed. Both are derived here, in the mapping layer, because both need the raw
 *  payloads: by the time a `ToolInvocation` exists the args are a flat string and
 *  the result is stringified JSON.
 *
 *  **Both return `undefined` rather than guessing.** No salient argument means the
 *  card falls back to the full `k=v` summary — today's behavior — and no readable
 *  result means no outcome segment at all. A row that says nothing is better than
 *  a row that says something wrong, and the payloads here are provider- and
 *  tool-shaped, so "nothing matched" is a normal outcome, not a defect. */
