/** Global project state — the operator's working directories and which one is

 *  chat composer's code-mode picker share a single source of truth.
 *
 *  **The selection is the backend's, not ours.** `POST /projects/{id}/activate`
 *  persists it, and the response carries the whole listing back, so activating
 *  reseats from one shape rather than patching a local guess. What lives here is
 *  the echo plus the header the client sends (`~/lib/api/projectScope`), which only
 *  ever relays that selection — the backend decides what a scope means and
 *  re-resolves it on every request.
 *
 *  **Null is a real state, not an empty one.** No active project means the operator
 *  sees their unfiled work: exactly what the app showed before projects existed.
 *  Activating one *adds* that project's items to the unfiled ones; it never hides
 *  them. Another project's items are what stay invisible. */
