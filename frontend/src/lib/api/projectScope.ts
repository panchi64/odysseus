/**
 * The active project, as the client sends it — one `X-Ody-Project` header on every
 * REST call.
 *
 * Kept separate from both the API client and the projects store so neither has to
 * import the other (no cycle), exactly like `token.ts`: the store writes the
 * selection, the client reads it.
 *
 * This holds **no authority**. The backend resolves the operator's stored selection
 * on its own when the header is absent, so an unset value here is not "show nothing"
 * — it is "use whatever is active". The header exists so a surface can say something
 * the stored selection can't: `ALL` means *this request is deliberately unscoped*,
 * which is a different request from sending nothing at all.
 *
 * Mirrored to `localStorage` for the same reason the token is: a reload should not
 * silently drop the operator back into a different scope than the one they were
 * reading a moment ago. The backend is still the source of truth and re-resolves it.
