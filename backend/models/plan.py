"""The agent's task list for a conversation — one row per thread.

The model keeps its own plan while it works (`Planning`, `pydantic_ai_harness`), and the
operator watches it in chat. That list has to outlive the run that produced it: a browser
reload mid-turn, a run parked on an approval, a resumed stream, and the next turn in the
same thread all expect the same plan to still be there. So it is persisted rather than
held for the life of one run, keyed the way the sandbox workspace is keyed — by
conversation.

**One row, not one per task.** The whole list is read and rewritten together on every
mutation (the store's contract is list-shaped), it is small, and it is sealed as a unit —
a row per task would buy nothing and cost a join plus per-row sealing. The items are a
sealed JSON array: a plan is a verbatim description of what the operator asked for, which
is content, not policy (`XC-SEC-3`).
