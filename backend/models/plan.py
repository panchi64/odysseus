"""The plan a thread produced for the operator to approve — one row per conversation.

A *plan* here is the written document a Plan-level turn ends in: what the agent would do,
concretely enough to say yes to. It is not the agent's running checklist — that is
``models/task_list.py``, and keeping the two words apart is the whole reason both files
exist.

**One row, replaced on every revision.** A plan that came back with feedback is superseded
by the plan that answers it, and the superseded one is not a thing anyone asks for: the
transcript already holds every version as the arguments of the call that submitted it, with
the operator's response beside it, which is the version history that is actually read.
``revision`` counts up so the panel can tell a resubmission from a redraw.

**Sealed.** A plan restates what the operator asked for and names their files — content,
not policy (`XC-SEC-3`) — so the document is AEAD ciphertext like the task list beside it.
``status`` and ``revision`` stay in the clear: they are how the surface decides what to
render, they say nothing about the work, and a locked vault should still be able to report
that a thread is waiting on an answer.
