"""Calendar schema (`CAL-1..3`) — calendars and their events.

Two entities. A **`Calendar`** is a container the operator owns; it may be purely local
or bound to a remote CalDAV collection (`CAL-2`), in which case it carries that server's
URL plus sealed credentials. A **`CalendarEvent`** is one entry on it.

At-rest posture mirrors the rest of the app: the operator's own words — `title`,
`description`, `location`, the calendar's `name`, and the CalDAV username/password — are
sealed under the vault; **structural** fields stay in the clear because the DB has to
order and range-query them (`starts_at`/`ends_at`), match them on sync (`uid`,
`remote_href`), and expand them without decrypting (`rrule`, `timezone`, `all_day`).

## Recurrence is a rule, never rows

A recurring event is **one** row carrying its RFC 5545 ``RRULE`` string; occurrences are
expanded at read time (`services/calendar/recurrence.py`). Materializing occurrences
would make an open-ended rule unbounded and turn every edit into a rewrite of the series.
Per-occurrence deletions ride along as ``exdates`` (an RFC 5545 ``EXDATE`` set).

## Time zones are stored beside the instants, not folded into them

``starts_at``/``ends_at`` are UTC instants; ``timezone`` is the event's IANA zone. Both
are needed: the instant orders the event globally, and the zone is what a recurrence must
be expanded in, so a daily 09:00 meeting stays at 09:00 local **across a DST boundary**
rather than sliding an hour. An **all-day** event (``all_day``) is a *date* range, not an
instant range — it is stored as UTC midnights with an exclusive end (the RFC 5545
``DTEND`` convention for ``DATE`` values) and must never be zone-converted, so the 9th
is the 9th in Madrid and in Los Angeles alike.

    the same payload mean different things on two machines. That is the right rule for a
    multi-tenant service and the wrong one here: there is one operator, on one machine,
    and the events they create are for their own calendar. UTC meant "3pm" from an agent
    that had just been told the local time landed in the afternoon somewhere else.

    Portability is kept where it actually lives — the key is read from the host in a
    POSIX-portable way (:mod:`core.timezone`) and *validated* against the tz database here,
    so a `TZ` holding a POSIX rule string, a container with no zoneinfo link, or a bare
    offset falls back to UTC rather than reaching a caller that will try to construct a
    `ZoneInfo` from it. Resolved once at import: the host's zone does not change under a
    running process, and this is a column default.
