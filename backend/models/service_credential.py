"""Outbound service-credential schema.

A **service credential** is an API key the system uses to call an *outbound* third-party
service on the operator's behalf — today the mail OAuth client secrets. Owner-scoped,
one row per service id, with
the key sealed application-layer like every other secret (the same at-rest posture as the
model-endpoint / search-provider `api_key`). This is **not** inbound auth — issuing access
tokens to clients is a separate concern.
