"""Import every ``models.*`` module so its tables register on SQLModel metadata.

A class the process never imported has no mapper: Alembic would silently omit its
table from autogenerate/upgrade, and the backup walk would silently skip exporting
it. Both consumers call this instead of keeping a hand-list of imports that has to
be edited every time an entity lands — the module's presence in the package *is*
its registration.
