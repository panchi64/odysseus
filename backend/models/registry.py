"""Model role→endpoint registry schema.

A **role** (``main``, ``utility``, ``embedding``, later ``vision``/``image-gen``)
binds to an **ordered fallback chain** of endpoints. The chain is wrapped in
Pydantic AI's ``FallbackModel`` at resolution time, so a dead endpoint falls
through to the next.

An **endpoint** is a provider-agnostic OpenAI-compatible spec: a ``base_url`` +
``model`` name + optional key, plus the metadata the engine consumes — the
``context_window`` (feeds context reduction) and capability flags (native
tool-calling is required for the tool-driving roles, plus vision/thinking).

The **API key is the only sensitive field**: it is stored application-layer
encrypted (the chosen at-rest posture — whole-DB SQLCipher has no portable
3.14 wheels). Everything else is structural metadata the DB indexes in the clear.
The per-conversation ``main`` override is a runtime argument, not stored here.
