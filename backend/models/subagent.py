"""What links a sub-agent's transcript back to the thread that launched it.

The transcript itself needs no table. A sub-agent *is* a conversation — its messages are
ordinary ``Message`` rows, and an ephemeral conversation is hidden from the session list
but never reaped — so what it did is already durable. What is not durable without this row
is the **link**: which thread launched it, under what name, on what task, and how it ended.

Held only in memory, that link dies with the process, and the operator is left with a set
of unreachable conversations nothing can name. This row is what makes "show me what that
sub-agent did, and whether anything went wrong" answerable an hour later and a restart
later — which is the whole reason the transcripts are kept at all.

It is also the single source for three other readers that would otherwise each keep their
own count: the cap (how many are live), the parent's own wake (where to deliver a report),
and the panel (what to draw, live and finished). A second copy of any of those would be the
one that goes stale.

No ``__backup__``: like conversations themselves, a sub-agent's work is session history
rather than an operator preference, and it is exported — if at all — with the thread it
belongs to.

    spec_name: str

    #: ``blocked`` is a sub-agent parked on an approval the operator has not answered: not
    #: finished, not progressing, and the one state where the thing it waits for is a

    #: the run that would have finished it died with the process.

    #: a sandbox fork is merged and purged by ``workspace_key``, a worktree fork by
    #: (parent conversation, ``delegation_id``). Stored rather than re-derived, because an
