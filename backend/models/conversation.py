"""Conversation persistence schema.

A conversation owns a **tree** of messages, not a flat list. Each message stores
**both** a serialized Pydantic AI ``ModelMessage`` blob (full fidelity, so a cold
session rehydrates exactly) **and** a thin projection (kind + text) for listing
and search. The projection is derived, never authoritative.

The tree is what makes regenerate / edit / rewind possible. Every message points
at its predecessor via ``parent_id``; **messages sharing a parent are alternative
continuations — versions.** Regenerating an answer adds a sibling under the same
user request; editing a user turn adds a sibling under the same parent. The
conversation's ``active_leaf_id`` is the tip of the path the operator is currently
viewing — walking it parent-by-parent to the root yields the active history, the
flat list the agent actually runs against. ``seq`` is a per-conversation,
monotonically increasing creation counter; it no longer implies linear order, but
it gives siblings a stable version ordering (oldest first) and keeps writes
collision-free across branches.

    # with it on a cold load, where there is no live request to measure — the schemas and
    # the brief never reach the message history, so without this a reopened thread could
