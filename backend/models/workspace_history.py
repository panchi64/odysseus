"""Workspace history — content-addressed snapshots of the agent's sandbox.

After a turn that changed files, the workspace's text files are captured as a
**snapshot**: a point-in-time tree the operator can browse (code) and diff against
the previous one. File bytes are content-addressed and **encrypted at rest** under
the vault, deduped across snapshots by content hash; the snapshot's manifest
(path → hash) and small change-stats stay in the clear (like an artifact's
filename) — the file *content* does not.

Keyed by ``conversation_id`` — not a foreign key, because a snapshot can also come
from a stateless run (keyed by its run id). Every record carries the ``owner_id``
seam.
