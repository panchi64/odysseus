"""Scoped API token schema (`AUTH-4`).

**Inbound** auth: tokens issued to clients for programmatic access. Distinct from
``ServiceCredential``, which holds the outbound keys this system calls other services with.

A token is minted as ``odyt_<prefix>_<secret>``. The **prefix** is public — stored in the
clear so a presented token can be looked up by index, and shown in listings so the operator
can tell their tokens apart. The **secret** is never stored: only a one-way Argon2id hash of
it, the same posture as the login password (`XC-SEC-3`), so a token is shown once at issue
and is unrecoverable afterwards. Nothing here is vault-sealed, because there is nothing to
recover — a lost token is reissued, not decrypted.

``scopes`` is policy, not content (like ``ApprovalGrant.tool_name``), so it stays in the
clear: the set of API surfaces this token may reach, resolved against the catalog in
``core.api_scopes``. ``revoked_at`` is a tombstone rather than a delete, so a revoked
token's label and last use stay auditable.
