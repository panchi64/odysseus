"""Conversation-scoped tool auto-approval grants.

A grant records the operator's decision to auto-approve a given (namespaced) tool's
deferred calls within one conversation, for a bounded window (the TTL). While a grant is
active the engine resolves that tool's approval requests without re-prompting; an expired
or absent grant falls back to the strict per-call approval default. Grants are operator
policy, not content — structural fields only, so nothing here is vault-sealed — and
owner-scoped like every record.

A grant on a tool that *runs a command* is scoped narrower than the tool
(:attr:`ApprovalGrant.command_prefix`): "stop asking me about `uv run pytest`" is what the
operator means when they tick the box under a test run, and one yes to
``shell_run_command`` is not a yes to every command a thread will ever want.
