"""External tool schema — MCP servers, connectors, and per-tool trust (`MCP-*`, `INTEG-*`,
`AE-3.6`).

Three entities, one idea: the system can reach tools it did not write, so what it stores
about them splits cleanly into **connection** (how to reach the server/connector, whose
secrets are sealed) and **policy** (what the operator has allowed, which must stay
queryable).

- :class:`McpServer` — a registered external tool server. Its address/transport are
  structural and stay in the clear so the surface can list and index them; anything that
  authenticates (``env``, the auth credentials) is vault-sealed.
- :class:`Integration` — a connector instantiated from a static preset. Same split: the
  base URL is structural, the credentials are sealed.
- :class:`ExternalToolPolicy` — the operator's decision about **one tool**: whether it is
  offered to the agent at all (`MCP-1`'s per-tool enable/disable) and whether it runs
  without pausing for approval (`AE-3.6` trust). Like ``ApprovalGrant`` this is *policy
  rather than content*, so it is stored in the clear and indexed.

Trust is deliberately keyed **per tool, not per server**: registering or enabling a server
says nothing about what any tool on it may do, so a server-level trust flag would blanket-
approve tools the operator has never seen. A missing policy row means the safe default —
offered to the agent, but approval-gated.
