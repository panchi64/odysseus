"""Scheduled tasks — the operator's recurring/one-off/webhook automations.

A `ScheduledTask` is either an **agent** task (its prompt drives an ordinary Run,
in a fresh conversation created for that execution) or a **reminder** (its prompt is
delivered verbatim as a notification body — no AI phrasing). At-rest posture mirrors
notifications: `title`/`prompt` are the operator's own content, so they are encrypted
under the vault; schedule shape, output channel, and timestamps are structural
metadata the scheduler needs to query in the clear.

`pre_authorized` is policy, not content — like `ApprovalGrant.tool_name` — so it stays
in the clear: the scoped pre-authorization (`AE-3.5`) a task's unattended runs get,
seeded into a conversation grant at each execution.

`webhook_token` is this task's own analogue of the previews proxy's unguessable path
token — "the token IS the credential", compared for equality on an auth-exempt route,
never decrypted content the operator needs recovered from ciphertext. It is stored
in the clear (like the previews token, and like a session token in `core.auth`), not
vault-sealed, so it can be read back into a `webhookUrl` on every listing, and rotated
by simply replacing the column.

`TaskRun` is one execution record. The scheduler inserts a row (`outcome=None`) the
moment it fires a task and finalizes `outcome`/`finished_at` once the executor (or
notify) settles — so a row with `finished_at is None` is a still-live execution, the
non-overlap check's source of truth alongside the scheduler's own in-memory tracking.
