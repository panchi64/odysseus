"""Uploads schema — a stored file plus the text extracted from it.

The operator uploads a file; the system keeps the original bytes and makes the
file's *contents* usable (`UP-1`/`UP-2`). For PDFs that means pulling the embedded
text, falling back to a vision model for image-only/scanned pages; the extracted
text is retained per upload, correctable afterward, and indexed into the knowledge
corpus so the agent can retrieve it.

At-rest posture mirrors documents and artifacts: the content the upload *is* — its
raw ``blob`` and the ``filename`` and ``extracted_text`` derived from it — is
**encrypted at rest** under the vault. Structural metadata stays in the clear so the
DB can list, dedup, and route without unsealing: ``owner_id``, ``mime``,
``size_bytes``, the content ``sha256`` (a one-way digest, the duplicate-recognition
key for `UP-1`), the extraction ``status``, the ``vision`` flag, and timestamps.

Extraction runs off the request path, so a row is born ``queued`` and moves through
``extracting`` → ``done``/``error`` as the worker drains it.
