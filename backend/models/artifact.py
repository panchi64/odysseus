"""Published artifacts — the files an agent surfaces for preview.

When the agent produces something visual in its sandbox (an HTML report, a chart,
a code snippet), it *publishes* the file: the bytes are captured here, decoupled
from the sandbox's lifecycle, so the operator can preview them even after the
session is reaped. The bytes are **encrypted at rest** under the vault (they are
the operator's content) — and so are the two metadata fields that carry the
operator's own words, the title and the filename. A filename is not a routing
detail: ``q3-layoffs-draft.html`` says as much about the operator as the document
does, so it is sealed like every peer entity's equivalent (`XC-SEC-3`).

What stays in the clear is only what the UI needs to *route* to a preview without
a key: conversation, content type, kind, and size. That is the line
``Conversation.model`` already sits on — structural metadata, not content.

Keyed by ``conversation_id`` — not a foreign key, because an artifact can also
come from a stateless run (keyed by its run id), which is not a conversation row.
Every record carries the ``owner_id`` seam.
