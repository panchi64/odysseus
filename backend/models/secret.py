"""Password-vault schema (`VAULT-*`) — the operator's secrets manager.

See ``models/mail.py`` for why the module is imported before it declares anything.

This is the operator's user-facing secrets manager — an additional encrypted layer on top of
at-rest encryption — and is deliberately distinct from ``core/vault``, the password-derived
key custody that unlocks the app at login. Its unlocked state is held **in memory only and
never persisted**, so nothing here records whether the vault is open: the two tables below
carry only what must survive a restart — how to *re*-derive the key from a passphrase the
operator supplies again, and the sealed entries themselves.

**Two layers, two keys.** Every value an entry holds is sealed under the vault's own
passphrase-derived key first, and the resulting token is then sealed again by the login DEK
like any other sensitive column (`XC-SEC-3`). Reading one back therefore needs *both* locks
open, which is exactly what "an additional encrypted layer on top of at-rest encryption"
means: a login-unlocked process still cannot read a secret while the secrets manager is
locked.

Because names are ciphertext (and non-deterministic ciphertext at that), the DB cannot index
or uniquely constrain them — entry identity is the primary key, and a duplicate name is the
operator's business, not a schema violation.
