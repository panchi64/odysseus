"""Skills schema — a portable Agent Skills bundle, stored decomposed.

A skill is reusable know-how the agent applies to future tasks (`SKILL-1`…`SKILL-3`), and
its on-disk form is the **Agent Skills open standard** artifact: a ``SKILL.md`` with YAML
frontmatter plus whatever supporting files it ships (``scripts/``, ``references/``,
``assets/``). That artifact is the data model — these tables store it, they don't replace it,
which is what lets a skill move between here and Claude Code in either direction (D32).

**Decomposed, not a sealed zip.** The bundle is split across two tables rather than kept as
one opaque blob because all three requirements need its parts addressable: the per-turn
catalog injection (`SKILL-2`) reads name+description without touching file bytes, the
surgical edit (`SKILL-3`) needs the instruction body as its own column, and staging into the
sandbox writes files straight through with nothing to unzip. An ``Upload`` gets away with a
single ``blob_enc`` because an upload is opaque; a skill is structured.

At-rest posture follows documents and uploads (D17): the content the skill *is* — its
description, its instructions, its files' bytes, and any preserved non-standard frontmatter
— is sealed under the vault. What the database must index or the operator must be able to
filter stays in the clear: ``owner_id``, timestamps, the ``published`` flag, the ``source``,
each file's ``relpath``/``sha256``, and the ``name``. ``name`` in the clear is a deliberate,
slightly weaker posture than the rest: it is simultaneously the uniqueness key, the bundle's
directory name, and the handle the model calls the skill by, so it cannot be ciphertext —
the trade, and what it leaks, is recorded in D32.

``SKILL.md`` itself is **not** a ``SkillFile`` row: it is ``body_enc`` plus the frontmatter
columns, rendered on export, so the two can never drift out of agreement.
