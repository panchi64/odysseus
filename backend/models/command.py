"""Workflows schema — a prompt the operator wrote once and invokes by name.

The fourth source the command registry merges, and the only one it **owns**. The other
three are views onto things that exist for their own reasons: an action already has a
control in the interface, a skill is know-how the model opens, a sub-agent is a roster
entry. A workflow exists only to be typed — it is the operator saying "when I write
``/standup``, put this in front of the model" — so nothing else in the platform has a row
to lend it.

**Not a skill, though it is the near neighbour.** A skill is written for the *model* to
choose and open, carries a bundle of supporting files, and has to survive a round trip
through the Agent Skills standard. A workflow is a body of text with a name on it that only
the operator can reach. Storing one as a draft skill would put it in the model's catalog
(where it would be chosen by description and read as know-how) or leave it unpublished
(where it is invisible to everything, including the picker). Neither is what a saved prompt
is, which is why this is one small table rather than a flag on that one.

At-rest posture follows skills exactly, including the one deliberate weakening: ``name`` is
clear because it is the uniqueness key *and* the handle the operator types, so it cannot be
ciphertext. Everything that is content — the title, the one-line description the picker
shows, the argument hint, and the body itself — is sealed under the vault.

``enabled`` rather than ``published``, because they are not the same boundary and the word
matters. Publishing a skill hands it to the *model*; there is no equivalent act here, since
a workflow is never offered to anything but the picker. What this flag does is let a
half-written one stay out of the menu until its author is ready — a convenience, not a
trust decision, and calling it ``published`` would imply a gate that does not exist.
