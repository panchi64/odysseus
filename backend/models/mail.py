"""Mail schema (`EMAIL-*`) — accounts, the inbox cache, drafts, and the style profile.

Four tables, one per durable shape the mail capability needs:

- :class:`MailAccount` — one connected mailbox. Its **per-account secret** (an IMAP/SMTP
  password, or an OAuth ``{access_token, refresh_token, expires_at, scope}`` bundle) lives
  in a single sealed column here, sealed with the vault exactly like ``ModelEndpoint``'s
  ``api_key``. ``ServiceCredential`` is deliberately *not* reused: it is a static-catalog,
  one-key-per-service table and cannot express several accounts per provider, refresh
  tokens, or expiry. The OAuth *client* registration (the Google/Microsoft client id +
  secret, one per install) does belong there, and lives in its catalog.
- :class:`MailMessage` — the local inbox cache (`EMAIL-5`, `XC-PERF-4`), also the row the
  automatic triage (`EMAIL-2`) and the quoted/signature split (`EMAIL-4`) are stamped onto.
- :class:`MailDraft` — a composed or pre-generated reply (`EMAIL-3`), until it is sent.
- :class:`MailStyleProfile` — the writing-style profile learned from Sent mail (`EMAIL-3`),
  which the operator can view and edit.

**What is sealed vs clear.** Everything that is operator content — addresses, subjects,
bodies, snippets, AI summaries — is application-layer encrypted. What stays in the clear is
structural: the provider kind, host/port transport config (never a secret), the opaque
provider-side message uid, timestamps, and the triage *verdicts* (urgency, spam, category
tags) so the inbox can be filtered and ordered in the DB without decrypting every row.
