"""Conversation-scoped network egress grants.

A grant records that the operator approved one domain for one conversation's workspace,
on top of the installation-wide allowlist. Unlike an approval grant this has no TTL: it
names *where* the workspace may reach, and a package registry the operator opened for a
piece of work stays open for the rest of that work. The tool that asks for one is
approved per call regardless, so the row is the record of a decision already made rather
than a standing permission to make more.

Like ``ApprovalGrant`` this is operator policy, not content — a domain name is the thing
the operator read and agreed to — so nothing here is vault-sealed, and it is owner-scoped
like every record.
