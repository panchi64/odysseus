"""Notifications schema — the durable attention record.

The backend chassis's cross-cutting attention surface: something happened while the
operator wasn't watching (a sensitive action needs approval, a run finished or failed
unattended, later a scheduled task's outcome) and it needs to land somewhere durable and
actionable — distinct from the frozen per-run event stream (`runs/events.py`), which
dies with its run.

At-rest posture mirrors documents/memory: the content the notification *is* — its
``title`` and optional ``body`` — is encrypted; everything else (kind, links, timestamps,
read/resolved state) is structural metadata the DB can index and order by, so it stays in
the clear. ``task_id`` is a nullable seam for the scheduler's task outcomes (a later
phase) — nothing writes it yet.
