"""Owner-scoped key/value app settings.

A tiny persisted store for small operator preferences that aren't worth a bespoke table
— the first being the Cookbook's active quality source. Plain string values (not secret,
not relational); structured config still lives in ``core/config.py`` (env). Owner-scoped
like every record, so a per-user split later needs no rewrite.
