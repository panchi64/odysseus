"""Projects — a directory on the operator's machine, and the scope the app filters by.

A `Project` is one host path the operator works in, plus the git facts code mode
needs to work on it safely. Two things about the shape are load-bearing:

**`root_path_enc` is sealed.** A filesystem path names the operator's clients, employers
and habits as surely as a document's contents do, so it is encrypted at rest like every
other piece of their content. `base_ref` and the flags are structural — the worktree
machinery queries them and they reveal nothing on their own.

**`project_id` on a scoped entity is nullable, and null means *unfiled*, not *orphaned*.**
Unfiled rows are visible in every scope; a project's rows are visible when that project is
active; another project's rows are never visible. That single rule is what makes this
migration safe — every row that already exists is unfiled, so activating a project adds to
what the operator sees and never subtracts.
