"""Knowledge-corpus schema — the generic chunk store + the folder source registry.

The corpus is **one retrieval index** fed by many *sources* (the rich stores —
memory, conversations — plug in as adapters untouched; chunked reference content
— host folders now, uploads/gallery/research/document bodies later — lands here).

Two tables:

- ``CorpusChunk`` — the generic chunk store. One source item (a file) becomes
  *many* chunks (a token-window slice of its text). Each chunk carries the same
  at-rest posture as every other recall vector: the text and its embedding are
  **encrypted at rest** under the vault (an embedding is invertible enough to leak
  its text, so it is sealed too — which is why recall is brute-force-in-Python over
  the decrypted working set rather than an in-DB plaintext ANN
  index). Structural metadata (owner, source, ordinal, content hash, embedding
  provenance, timestamps) stays in the clear so the DB can segregate stale
  embeddings (`EMB-2`) and dedup on re-index.
- ``CorpusSource`` — the operator-added **folder** registry (path + crawl status).
  The path is **sealed** like the chunks it produces: a path into the operator's own
  filesystem names their projects, clients and habits, so it is user content
  (`XC-SEC-3`). The crawl status stays in the clear so the ``/rag`` list can order
  and segregate rows without a key.

The chunk's embedding ``model`` + ``dim`` are recorded (`EMB-2`): when the operator
changes the embedding model, existing vectors are a different space, so retrieve
falls back to keyword for them until a rebuild re-embeds them.
