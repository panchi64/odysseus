"""dropped the service credentials nothing calls any more

Three outbound services existed only for surfaces that have been removed. Artificial
Analysis and llm-stats supplied model-quality rankings to the Cookbook's
recommendations; the HuggingFace token lifted the anonymous rate limit while downloading
weights. Odysseus works off endpoints now — it ranks no models and downloads no weights —
so nothing reads any of the three, and their rows in `KNOWN_SERVICES` are gone.

Dropping the catalog entry alone would leave any stored key sealed in this table and
**unreachable**: `status()` returns whatever rows exist, but the Service Keys section
renders one row per *declared* service, so an operator could neither see the key nor
clear it. A secret you cannot find is worse than one you can, so the rows go with the
declaration.

This deletes data, and the downgrade cannot bring it back — the plaintext was never
recoverable from this table by design (it is sealed with the vault key), and re-adding
empty rows would only be a lie about what is stored. An operator who wants one of these
keys back re-enters it, against whatever declares it next.
