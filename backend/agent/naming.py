"""Naming a fresh conversation, and getting out of the way when it can't.

``title.py`` is the model call — given some messages, produce a short name. This is
everything around it: when a thread is eligible to be named, the two paths that name one,
persisting the result without ever clobbering a name the operator chose, and announcing it
on the run's stream.

Two paths, because the two orchestrators reach completion differently:

- A **fresh chat turn** starts the namer up front (:func:`start_title`), concurrently with
  the answer, and announces the moment the name lands — so naming adds no post-answer
  delay. The trade is that the task outlives the awaited turn, and abandoning it needs
  care: before the name exists, cancelling costs nothing; past that point the persist and
  the emit must not be split, or the name reaches the database but never the client.
  :class:`Namer` carries exactly that distinction.
- A **resumed turn** has no prompt in hand and no window to overlap with, so it names
  afterwards from the just-persisted history (:func:`maybe_title`).

Best-effort throughout: a failure here leaves a thread untitled, which is a cosmetic loss,
and must never disturb a finished turn.
