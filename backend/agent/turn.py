"""One turn, driven to its end: an answer, a park, or a stop at a bound.

The loop around ``agent.iter()`` — the segment structure of a turn (the initial model
pass, then a continuation for every batch of deferred calls that settles without the
operator), the one usage budget / no-progress guard / usage accumulator they share, the
live gauge frame as each response lands, mid-run steering drained at both boundaries, and
the four ways a turn stops that are *state* rather than errors: a usage bound, the loop
breaker, a context overflow, and a call that needs the operator.

It is its own file because it is the one thing both orchestrators and the verifier's
corrective re-attempt run: ``engine.py`` sequences a run around it and ``verify.py`` calls
it a second time, and neither of those is the reason this loop would change. The policy it
applies is elsewhere — ``gating.py`` rules on the deferred calls, ``parking.py`` builds the
continuation, ``folding.py`` recovers from an overflow, ``model_errors.py`` reads the
provider's failure — so what is left here is control flow.

Nothing here reads settings for itself: the caller resolves one settings object and passes
it in, so every bound and every frame of a turn is measured against the same values.
