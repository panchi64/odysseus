"""Fingerprinting each request's cacheable prefix, and saying where the last one stopped
matching it.

The instrument behind the caching work, and the reason it comes before any fix. A slow local
turn has three candidate causes and they are indistinguishable from the outside:

1. something in the **head** moved — a dormant group revealed, the permission level narrowed
   mid-turn, a skill published, the project's own brief edited by the agent in its own
   worktree — and the whole history behind it was re-read;
2. a **batch of reviews** ran with no shared prefix between them;
3. a **background call** on the same server evicted the chat's cached state.

From a ``ttft_ms`` spike alone all three look identical. This says which: cause 1 announces
itself as a head change naming the block that moved, and its absence is what leaves the other
two standing. Deterministic, needs no cooperation from the server, and costs one pass of
BLAKE2b over a request we are already assembling.

**Where the reading comes from.** ``before_model_request`` is handed the exact
``ModelRequestParameters`` about to go out — the instruction parts with the name each was
contributed under, the tool definitions in offered order, and the outgoing message list. Same
public seam :mod:`agent.overhead` measures from, and a separate capability for the same reason
that one is separate from :mod:`agent.injections`: it answers a different question and would
change for a different reason. Three passes over the same parts is three hashes of a few tens
of kilobytes, against a request the model is about to spend seconds on.

**Digests, never copies** — see :mod:`runs.prefix`, which owns the value types and the
cross-turn ledger.
