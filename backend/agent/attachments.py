"""Chat attachments — a file goes to the agent's computer, not into its context.

A document the operator attaches is **staged into the conversation's sandbox** (``/work``)
under ``attachments/`` and announced to the model as a short marker: filename, upload id,
mime, size, and the path it lives at. The model then decides what to read and pages
through the file itself with its files/code tools. Nothing of the file's *text* enters the
prompt — a 300-page PDF costs the same handful of marker tokens as a one-line note, and
the model reads only the parts it actually needs.

Two shapes still come back, and the split now matters for images only:

- :attr:`ResolvedAttachments.content` — what the live attach turn sees.
- :attr:`ResolvedAttachments.persisted` — what replayed history carries.

An **image** is handed to a vision model as pixels and retained inline in both (there is
nothing to "sift through" in a picture, and no way to re-see one on demand), so for images
the two differ from a document only in kind. Its bytes are staged too, so code can crop or
convert it without a round-trip. For a **document** the two shapes are identical: the
marker, and only the marker.

**Degrade path.** The sandbox is fail-closed and can be unavailable (no runtime, a locked
vault, a workspace that won't open). Pointing the model at a path that doesn't exist would
be worse than a big prompt, so when staging fails the file's extracted text is handed over
**inline and in full**, and the marker says exactly that instead of naming a path.

**Staleness is announced, not hidden.** Sandbox sessions are per-conversation and
recyclable: a thread replayed days later may find nothing at the staged path. The marker
tells the model so, and names ``attachments_provision`` (re-stage by id, same path) and
``corpus_retrieve`` (semantic search over the text) as the two ways back.
