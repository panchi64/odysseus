"""Everything a fold needs, settled once per turn.

Compaction can fire from three places inside one turn — the prelude's projected trigger,
the in-turn recovery after a provider refuses an over-long request, and the same recovery
on a resumed (previously parked) turn — and from the operator's own button. Each needs the
same facts, and none of them is derivable where the in-turn recovery fires: ``drive_turn``
has no settings store and no policy, and a parked turn resumes minutes later in a
different orchestrator entirely.

So the facts travel as one frozen value, built where they are known and carried to where
they are used — including onto :class:`~agent.parking.ParkedTurn`, so an approval resume
can recover from an overflow exactly as the original turn would have. A ``None`` context
means "this turn cannot fold" (a stateless run), which is a state the recovery path has to
handle anyway.

**The summary is written by the turn's own agent**, so the context carries that agent and
the deps it runs with rather than a model of its own: the summarizer's request is the
turn's replay plus one message, sent on the same brief and the same tool array, which is
what lets a local engine reuse the prefix it already holds (``agent/compaction_summary.py``).

It lives in its own module rather than in the engine because ``parking.py`` holds one and
the engine imports ``parking``; the other direction would be a cycle.
