"""Reshaping a message list before it is handed to a model, or reading a fact back out of
one, before either reaches the store.

Surgeries the chat engine performs on ``list[ModelMessage]``, none of which needs a Run, a
store, or anything else the orchestrators carry. They are here rather than inline because
each encodes a fact about how the library or a provider behaves — a dangling tool call is
a provider error, adjacent requests get merged at wire-prep, a revealed tool is remembered
only by the history that reveals it — and those facts are worth finding in one place when
one of them changes.

Every one returns new objects. The store's in-memory tree hands out its messages by
reference, so mutating one in place would corrupt the durable history of every later read.

    ``start`` is measured against the list.

    ``_finalize`` persists ``result.all_messages()[start:]`` with ``start`` the length of
    the history we handed in. That only holds while the library gives the history back at
    the length we supplied it — and it does not: preparing the wire format merges
    consecutive requests (most chat APIs cannot carry two user messages in a row), so
    ``all_messages()`` comes back *shorter* than what went in and ``start`` silently points
    one message too far, dropping the operator's own message from the turn it persists.

    Two things produce adjacent requests here, and both are load-bearing: a compaction
    checkpoint hoisted in front of a retained tail that opens on a user prompt, and
    :func:`split_injected_requests`' own output replayed on the *next* turn. Normalizing
    up front costs nothing (the library was going to do exactly this) and makes the index
    honest in both cases. New objects throughout — the store's in-memory tree shares these
    messages, so nothing here may mutate one in place.

    **Why not use the library's own boundary.** ``AgentRunResult.new_messages()`` slices at
    an index Pydantic AI maintains for exactly this hazard, and it is correct — for one
    agent run. Ours is not one agent run. A single operator-facing turn can span several:
    a continuation after the operator queued more text mid-answer, an approval resume, a
    verifier correction. Each re-enters with a rebuilt history, so the library's index
    marks the start of the *last* run's new messages, not of the turn — on a corrective
    re-attempt it points two messages into a turn that began at zero. On top of that, four
    of the five things measured against ``start`` (the timeout flush, the cancel flush, the
    error flush, the park) happen where no result exists to ask. So ``start`` stays ours,

    An index alone is not enough. A history rebuilt mid-turn — an overflow fold hoisting a
    checkpoint in front of a turn that opens on the operator's prompt — has two consecutive
    requests at the boundary, and both the library and :func:`merge_consecutive_requests`
    collapse those into **one** message that belongs half to the history and half to the
    turn. Slicing at a message index there either re-persists the checkpoint (and, once the
    library writes its history-processor output back, the whole reinjected brief) as new
    operator messages, or drops the operator's own prompt from the turn it records.

    So the boundary is a message index *and* how many of that message's parts are the
    turn's own. It is counted from the **end**, because the front of a shared message is
    not stable: the library prepends the run's system prompt to the first request it sends
    and hoists tool results ahead of user-facing parts when it merges. The turn's own
    prompt is what the merge appended, so it stays at the tail — and the tail is what can
    be counted. ``parts`` is zero for every turn that never folded (nearly all of them) and
    :meth:`slice` is then exactly the plain list slice it always was. Mutable, because an

    that loaded it are still being replayed — and vanishes the moment they aren't. That is
    what makes this a *reader* rather than a piece of state: the only honest answer to "what
    is revealed" is the one read off the same messages the library will read.

    Three shapes say it, because the library records the reveal wherever the provider put
    it — a local ``search_tools`` return, a native server-side search return, or a bare
    availability delta (which is also the shape we carry a reveal across a compaction fold
    in, since the fold takes the exchange that revealed it away). Order is
    first-appearance rather than a set: a reveal replayed in a stable order keeps the
