"""The per-conversation work summary — what this thread actually did, in two or three
sentences, for the operator coming back to it an hour or a day later.

It hangs off a background sweep (:mod:`services.work_summaries`) rather than off a turn:
the account is only worth writing once the work has stopped moving, and a summary
regenerated per turn would be a utility-model call per turn for a band nobody is looking
at while they are still typing in the thread.

**The input is where the design is.** The titler next door (:mod:`agent.title`) feeds its
model *only* the operator's own turns, which keeps a small, unguarded model entirely off
injectable content. This cannot do that and still answer its question: what the *agent*
did lives in the agent's own answers and tool calls, which is model-derived text, and a
page it fetched may be quoted inside either. So the trusted-channel discipline is replaced
with a fence rather than dropped — the operator's turns stand in the clear because they are
the one voice in the thread that is theirs, and everything model-authored goes inside
:func:`core.untrusted.untrusted_fence` under one shared nonce announced once at the top,
for the reason a stored summary always needs it: the output is stored
and shown to the operator as the workspace's own account of the thread, so a fetched page
must not be able to speak in that voice.

**Fenced per turn, not once for the whole transcript.** One block would be cheaper, but the
summary's whole job is to say what was asked *and then* what was done about it, and a
transcript that lists every operator turn and then every model turn has thrown away the
pairing the summary is made of.

**Tool *returns* are excluded outright.** They are simultaneously the bulkiest part of a
thread and the most injectable, and they are redundant here: each call carries the model's
own ``narration`` — one sentence saying why it made that call (``tools/describe.py``) — and
the answer text says what came of it. A fold has to preserve what a tool returned because the thread
continues on it; a re-entry band does not.

Best-effort throughout, like the titler: a model error, a timeout or an empty reply degrades
to "no summary this sweep" and the band simply shows the last one (or nothing). Nothing here
raises.
