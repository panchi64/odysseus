"""The second look at a finished answer, and the one correction it is allowed.

A turn that produced an answer is not necessarily a turn that produced a *good* one, and
the model that wrote it is the last thing that should be asked. So a completed turn goes
to a judge — an injected one, or the utility model standing in — and a failed verdict
buys exactly one more pass: a synthetic nudge carrying the reason, re-driven through
:func:`~agent.turn.drive_turn`, with the rejected answer and the nudge marked for removal
so the persisted thread reads original request → corrected answer.

The bounds are the whole reason this is its own module rather than a branch in the
orchestrator. The correction is a *second* full pass over a history that has just finished
its first, so it runs at the turn's peak pressure and it cannot fold (its drop range is a
pair of absolute indices into the pre-fold history). Every way that can end — no room to
try, a park for approval, a bound mid-correction — has to carry the drop range somewhere
the persist will find it, and getting one of them wrong persists an answer nobody wrote.
