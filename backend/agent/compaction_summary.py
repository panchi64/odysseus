"""The summary itself — how the turn's own model writes it, and how the text that comes
back is handled.

**The summary is the conversation continuing.** It is written by the agent the turn runs
on, against exactly the replay that agent would be sent — the same brief, the same tool
array, the same messages, normalised the same way — with one user message appended asking
for the briefing. So the request shares its whole prefix with the one the model last
served, and a local engine reads the thread from the KV cache it already holds instead of
prefilling it again for a different model. It is also the model that did the work, reading
the work in its own format rather than a re-rendered transcript of it.

Three things keep it a *side* run rather than a turn:

- **``tool_choice='none'``**, so the tool definitions stay in the request (the prefix is
  unchanged) while the model is told to answer in text. Some local servers ignore the
  setting; a reply that calls a tool anyway is a failed fold, and the call never runs —
  the node that would execute it is never reached.
- **It is marked a side run** (``agent.emit.SIDE_RUN``), and its stream goes nowhere but
  the summary deltas. The capabilities that observe a request each handle that on their
  own terms: ``MeasureOverhead`` measures and emits into nothing, so ``Run.context_overhead``
  is untouched; ``AnnounceInjections`` and ``WatchPrefix`` hold state on themselves for the
  life of the agent, so they step aside rather than mark the brief announced or remember a
  request the turn never sent; ``ReinjectSystemPrompt`` and the tool-search and code-mode
  capabilities run as they would on any request, because they shape the prefix that has to
  match; the harness's ``WarnOnCacheBusts`` keeps its state per run and may usefully warn.
- **Only the answer text is kept.** The model may think — its normal reasoning settings
  apply — but a ``ThinkingPart`` is never part of the summary, and a ``<think>`` block
  inlined into the content is stripped before the text can become the thread's memory.

No call is bounded by time or output length: the summary is the thread's only memory of
what it replaces.

**Handling what comes back is text-only.** The summary is asked for in fixed sections
(``prompts/utility.py``'s ``COMPACT_INSTRUCTIONS``) for two reasons that need the text to
be *parseable*, not merely readable:

- **Anchors survive every fold.** Exact paths, ids, names and numbers are what a
  re-summarized summary loses first — each pass paraphrases a little more until the file
  path the thread was working on is "the config file". So a second fold carries the
  previous checkpoint's Anchors section forward **verbatim** instead of asking a model to
  restate it.
- **Tool-sourced facts stay marked as data.** The checkpoint is replayed as a
  user-shaped message, which is the most authoritative voice in the history; the one
  section that repeats what a web page or a document said is fenced before it is stored,
  so a fold cannot promote fetched text into an instruction the model trusts.

Both operations are text-in/text-out and model-free: a summary that comes back without the
headings degrades to "no carry-forward, nothing fenced" rather than failing the fold.
