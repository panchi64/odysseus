"""The meta-loop — what we own *around* the agent's within-turn reasoning.

Two independent mechanisms:

- :class:`LoopBreaker` is **always on**. It watches the tool calls a turn makes
  and aborts when the agent repeats an identical call *and gets an identical
  answer* instead of converging — a no-progress guard the model can't talk its
  way past.
- The **verifier** is opt-in. After a turn produces an answer, a judge (the
  utility model, or an injected stub) decides whether the request was actually
  satisfied; if not, the engine makes a single bounded corrective re-attempt.

    **The answer is half the signature, and leaving it out was a real bug rather than a

    depends on state this process does not own returns something new every time it is
    called with the same arguments, and a guard reading arguments alone counts that as
    going nowhere. The browser is the clearest case — `snapshot()` takes no arguments at
    all, so reading the page after the first click, the second and the third is three
    identical calls and the third one killed the turn, in the middle of exactly the
    step-by-step work those tools exist for. It is not only the browser: polling a
    background command with `shell_check_command`, re-reading a file a build is writing,
    and re-listing a directory after creating something in it are the same shape.

    So a call is recorded when it is made and settled when its result arrives, and the
    count advances only while a signature keeps producing the *same* answer. A genuine
    loop still trips on exactly the call it used to: three identical questions with three
    identical answers is a model going in circles, whatever the tool.

    A tool that never returns — a call abandoned by a failed turn — simply leaves its
    pending entry behind; both maps live and die with the turn.
