"""Conversation compaction — folding a thread's older turns into a summary its own model
writes.

**The product's only context reduction** (`AE-5.4`, `CHAT-4`), and the only one that ever
existed for a good reason: it fires on *measured pressure*, when a thread's footprint has
actually reached the operator's share of the model's context window. Everything else that
used to shrink content — digesting prior-turn tool results, capping an attachment's inline
text, trimming a code run's stdout — fired unconditionally, on turns under no pressure at
all, and has been removed. A large tool result now rides into context whole; the run's own
context-overflow stop is what catches a pathological turn.

Three properties make this safe to run automatically:

- **It never fires underneath reasoning in flight.** The trigger sits in the orchestrator
  prelude, before the agent runs, and measures what the turn *about to run* will cost. The
  one exception is the recovery: when a provider refuses a request as over-long, the turn
  folds once and re-sends that same request — between two requests, with nothing in
  flight, which is the only mid-turn moment at which folding is safe.
- **Nothing is destroyed.** The summary is appended as a new checkpoint node; the turns it
  covers stay in the tree, in the operator's transcript, and in cross-chat search. Only
  what is *re-sent to the model* narrows (``ConversationStore.model_history``). A rewind
  above the checkpoint restores the full replay for free.
- **It is still not a safety net.** A fold gets *one* attempt at an overflow. A request
  that is too big after it is too big for a reason folding cannot reach, and the run stops
  with a context notice rather than re-folding a thread down to nothing. Compaction lowers
  the pressure; it never silently drops content to force a fit.

How the summary is written, and how the text it produces is trusted afterwards, live next
door in :mod:`agent.compaction_summary`: the turn's own agent continues its own
conversation with one more message asking for the briefing, so the local engine reuses the
prefix it already holds, and what comes back has its anchors carried across folds verbatim
and its tool-sourced facts fenced on the way into the checkpoint. This module owns *when* a
thread folds and *what is recorded*.

**A fold keeps no retained tail.** It summarizes everything since the newest checkpoint —
that checkpoint's own summary included — and the new summary alone carries the thread
from there: nothing is replayed word for word beneath it. A single exchange that filled
the window folds whole; only a thread with nothing after its newest checkpoint has
nothing to fold.

    folded or how it is recorded.

    failure is not: the operator pressing "compact now" should be told the write failed, not
    that there was nothing to fold. :func:`agent.folding.fold` wraps this so a turn never
    dies for a compaction it only wanted as an optimization.

    ``agent`` and ``deps`` are the turn's own: the summary is written by the model the
    thread runs on, continuing its own conversation (:mod:`agent.compaction_summary`).

    ``on_plan`` is called once the fold is known and *before* the summarizer runs — the one
    moment at which what is about to be folded can be announced, since the summarizer call
    is the seconds-long part. The engine emits ``compaction.started`` from it; a caller with
