"""Suspending a turn on the operator — the payload and the park itself.

A turn that reaches a call nobody has authorised does not fail and does not guess: it
*stops*, with everything needed to carry on later held on the run. The same is true of a
turn that reaches a question only the operator can answer. That continuation is
:class:`ParkedTurn`, and :func:`park_for_input` is the one place it is built.

**Two reasons to stop, one park.** Pydantic AI hands back both piles on a single
``DeferredToolRequests`` — ``approvals`` for the calls awaiting permission, ``calls`` for
the ones awaiting a value (``tools/builtin.py``'s ``ask_user``) — and a turn can arrive
here holding both. Parking once for the pair is not a convenience: each park is one
resume, and a turn that parked twice would resume twice, running the approved call against
a history the second resume had already moved past.

**Why a payload rather than a re-run.** Pydantic AI ends the turn with
``DeferredToolRequests`` *without executing* the sensitive call, so the agent, the message
history and the deferred requests are all still in hand. Keeping them means a resume
continues the same turn — same agent, same tools, same history — instead of replaying a
prompt against whatever the world looks like when the operator finally answers. Every
field on the payload exists because re-deriving it on resume would be a second, disagreeing
source for a fact the parked turn already settled.

**Why the notify happens before the park.** ``RunRegistry.cancel`` reads
``awaiting_input`` as "the task has already fully exited" and skips its hard-cancel path on
that assumption. Anything that awaits *after* ``run.park(...)`` would break it, so the one
await this module does before parking is deliberately ordered ahead of it.

The rules deciding which *approvals* get here at all are ``gating.py``'s; this module only
knows what to do once a call needs the operator. Questions have no such rules — nothing can
answer one in the operator's place — so every deferred call reaches them.
