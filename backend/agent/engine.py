"""The agent engine — the first real orchestrator on the Run substrate.

Wraps Pydantic AI's ``Agent`` and drives it via ``agent.iter()`` so the chassis
can observe every step and stream it (translation lives in ``translate.py``).
The library owns the within-turn loop, tool selection, validation, and fallback;
we own the run lifecycle, the event stream, bounds, and the approval pause/resume
for sensitive actions.

A turn is driven by :func:`agent.turn.drive_turn`, shared by the initial run and every
resume. When the model requests a sensitive (approval-required) tool, Pydantic AI
ends the turn with ``DeferredToolRequests`` *without executing it*; we surface
``approval.required``, park the Run (``awaiting_input``), and stash a
:class:`ParkedTurn` so an approve decision can resume exactly where it left off.
``ask_user`` takes the same road for the other reason a turn stops on the operator:
the call defers for an *answer* rather than a permission, and the answer they give
comes back as the call's own result.

What lives *here* is the sequencing of one run and nothing else: arm the stop-flush
hooks, prepare the turn, drive it, verify it, record it, name the thread, write the
overhead — plus the error and ``finally`` paths that hold when any of that is cut short.
A turn's settings are resolved **once**, here, and handed to everything the sequence
calls — ``prelude``, ``turn``, ``verify``, ``folding``, ``metrics``, ``finalize``, none of
which reads them for itself — so a turn's fold threshold, its bounds and every gauge frame
measure against one set of values rather than each re-reading the cached singleton.
(``naming.py`` and ``gating.py``, carved out of this file long before those were, still
read their own.) The neighbours below carry the concerns that aren't the sequence, each
with its own reason to change and its own module docstring saying what it owns:

- ``factory.py`` — building the turn's ``Agent``: what it is told, what it is offered.
- ``prelude.py`` — everything settled before the model is called, in a load-bearing order.
- ``turn.py`` — one turn to its end: the ``agent.iter`` loop and the three ways it stops.
- ``verify.py`` — whether a finished turn is worth judging, and its one bounded correction.
- ``folding.py`` — when a *turn* folds the thread, and what that does to its persistence
  boundary. (``summarize.py`` is the fold itself.)
- ``metrics.py`` — the context gauge and the room check.
- ``finalize.py`` — where a finished turn goes, and what a park hands its eventual resume.
- ``flush.py`` — persisting a turn that was stopped from outside, shared by both
  orchestrators so a bound, a cancel and an unhandled exception cannot drift apart.
- ``history.py`` — the surgeries on a message list before it reaches a model or the store.
- ``naming.py`` — when and how a fresh thread gets named. (``title.py`` is the model call.)
- ``model_errors.py`` — reading a provider's failure, and what the operator is told.
- ``gating.py`` — ruling on the calls a turn deferred. The rules are ``services/permissions``'.
- ``parking.py`` — the park itself, and the continuation payload a resume works from.

    """Build the orchestrator for one chat turn (one always-agent path).

    ``prompt`` is the operator's message, or ``None`` to **regenerate**: re-run
    from a history that already ends in the user request (the caller moved the
    active leaf there), producing a fresh answer as a sibling of the previous one.

    ``attachment_ids`` are files the operator attached to *this* message (resolved via
    ``uploads``). Their original bytes are staged into the conversation's sandbox and the
    turn carries a short marker naming each file and its path — the model reads and pages
    through the file itself rather than having its text poured into context. ``vision``
    additionally hands an image over as pixels, which is the one attachment kind that
    still rides inline (and is retained on persist). Attachments are injected only on a
    fresh turn; a regenerate (``prompt is None``) re-runs prior history, which already
    carries the markers.

    ``model`` is the resolved ``main`` model (the route resolves it from the
    registry, with any per-conversation override). ``categories`` overrides the
    tool catalog, and ``dormant`` — category → one-line summary — names the groups within
    it whose schemas the model loads for itself, so this turn pays for them only if it
    asks. The verifier's judge is ``judge`` if injected, else one built
    from ``utility_model`` when given; with neither, verification is skipped (a
    graceful degradation when no utility model is configured). ``utility_settings``
    carries that model's reasoning-off settings so the judge, like the namer, requests
    reasoning off. With ``store`` +
    ``conversation_id`` the turn continues prior history and persists its new
    messages; without them it runs stateless. The verifier only runs when enabled
    in settings (and, by default, only on tool-producing turns). With
    ``title_model`` (and ``title_enabled`` in settings) the *first* completed turn
    of a fresh thread is auto-named; ``title_settings`` carries the model's
    reasoning-off settings so the namer runs fast.

    ``request_limit`` is the turn's model-round-trip ceiling — the operator's setting
    when the caller resolved one, else the config default. It bounds the *whole* turn,
    grant-resume and mid-run-steering continuations included, so a steady drip of
    steering messages can't extend it.

    ``binding`` is the thread's workspace binding — its mode and its project — read off
    the conversation by the caller. It decides where this turn's file work happens
    (``services/workspace.py``) and, through ``disabled_tools``, which tools belong in it.

    A completed turn writes what its request weighed besides the conversation onto the
    thread (``ConversationStore.set_overhead``), so a later *reload* can still break the
    context down — a cold load has no request to measure, and neither the standing brief
    nor the tool schemas reach the message history.

    ``context_thresholds`` are the operator's severity boundaries for that window — the
    fullness at which the composer's gauge turns amber and then red. They only decide the
    ``level`` on the emitted metrics; nothing in the turn's behaviour keys off them.

    ``auto_compact`` is the conversation-compaction policy (the operator's default folded
    with any per-thread override; absent ⇒ the config defaults). When the replayed history
    *plus the turn about to run* would reach its share of ``context_window``, the turns
    before the retained tail are summarized onto a checkpoint before the agent runs, and
    the turn continues from that summary. The same fold is the recovery when a provider
    refuses an over-long request mid-turn. The summarizer is ``utility_model`` — the same
    cheap model the namer and the judge use — and ``utility_context_window`` is that
    model's own window, which bounds the transcript it is handed.
