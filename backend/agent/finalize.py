"""Where a finished turn goes — the one place a turn is written down.

Every way a turn can end converges here: it answered, it hit a bound, it was flushed
from outside (:mod:`agent.flush`), it parked for an approval, or it was cancelled while
still parked. Each of those has its own control flow in the orchestrators, and each of
them would otherwise have needed its own opinion about the persistence boundary, the
verifier's drop range and a turn's attachments — five opinions that could disagree, on
the one operation that is not repeatable.

So the branch that decides *persist now* versus *hand the resume what it needs to persist
later* lives in a single function, and the flush module records through a closure over it
rather than knowing the engine's turn type at all. The park's context is fixed at the
moment it parked (:func:`parked_context`), so a resume's flush and a cancel-while-parked
agree with the park itself about where the turn began.
