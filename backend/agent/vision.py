"""Vision OCR — the codebase's first multimodal model call.

The engine-layer implementation of the :class:`~services.upload_extraction.VisionOCR`
seam the upload extractor depends on. It belongs here, beside the conversation namer,
because it *runs a model*: the registry resolves a vision-capable endpoint and a bare
``make_utility_agent`` transcribes a page image — the same one-shot utility-call shape
as titling, just with image input. Keeping it in ``agent/`` lets the extractor stay a
pure services-layer capability that never imports the engine.

A vision model is resolved **once per document** (``prepare``) and reused across its
pages, so a 40-page scan isn't 40 registry resolutions. Each page transcription is
bounded by a timeout so a slow or stuck model can't hold an upload's extraction open.
