"""Files the operator named with `@` — a reference, never an injection.

The turn carries the **paths** and nothing else. The model reads what it needs with
``files_read_file``, which is classified a read (``services/tool_sensitivity``) and so
costs no approval at any level, and pages through a large file itself rather than having
its text poured into the window.

That is the same call the attachment path already makes, and for the stated reason: the
inline-text cap was removed from this codebase in favour of handing the model a file with
a path. A reference also cannot go stale in history — an `@` from twenty turns ago names
a file that has since changed, and a copy of its old contents replaying forever would be
worse than useless.

**Resolved against the run's own workspace**, not against whatever the picker listed. The
two are normally the same tree, but a thread whose worktree was created between the pick
and the send would otherwise carry a path from the operator's checkout into a turn that
cannot see it. A path that does not resolve is dropped rather than reported: the operator
still has their typed message, and a turn refused over a file they can simply mention
again is a worse trade than a turn that runs with one fewer reference.
