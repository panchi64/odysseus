"""Naming a fresh conversation — a fast, best-effort-reasoning-off utility call.

After a brand-new conversation's first turn lands, the chassis asks the utility
model for a short descriptive title so the operator never has to name a thread.
The thread is named for what the *operator* asked — only the first user message is
fed to the namer, never the assistant's reply — so the title mirrors the request,
not the answer. The task is trivial, so the call is deliberately cheap. The engine
emits the result as ``conversation.titled`` and persists it; the frontend reveals
it with a typing animation.

Reasoning is requested *off* — provider-shaped, decided in :mod:`services.reasoning`;
the caller resolves the model and its reasoning-off
:class:`~pydantic_ai.settings.ModelSettings` together (the registry does this) and
hands both in, so this module stays free of per-lab levers. But some runtimes ignore
that lever (e.g. LM Studio drops OpenAI ``chat_template_kwargs``, and the Qwen 2507+
line dropped the ``/no_think`` soft-switch), so a model can reason anyway. We don't
fight that here — we *tolerate* it: the caller hands in a generous ``max_tokens`` so a
``<think>`` block has room to clear *and* still emit the title, and :func:`_clean` runs
``core.text.strip_think_blocks`` over the output — the same call the compaction summarizer
makes, since both face the identical runtime. A strict endpoint with no off-switch simply
reasons within that budget.
