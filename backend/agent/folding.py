"""When a *turn* folds the thread, how the fold is announced, and what it does to the
turn's persistence boundary.

``summarize.py`` is the fold itself — what gets read and what gets written. :func:`fold`
here is the layer above it that **every** trigger goes through: it announces the fold with
the ``compaction.started``/``conversation.compacted`` pair and hands back what happened.
The operator's own "compact now" reaches it from ``routes/conversations.py``; the two
turn-shaped triggers reach it through the wrappers below.

The rest of this module is the part only a *turn* can know: the projected check that fires
a fold between turns, the mid-turn recovery that fires one after a provider refused the
request, and the rebuild of the history the retried request is sent against with the
``TurnStart`` boundary moved to match. A fold inside a turn moves the line between what the
thread already had and what this turn is about to persist; nowhere else has to think about
that, which is why it is here and not there.

Nothing here reads settings for itself: the value rides on the ``CompactionContext`` the
turn built once, so every reading of the thread's size in one turn is against one object.

    **The one path every fold takes**, whichever trigger fired — the prelude's projected
    threshold, the mid-turn overflow recovery, or the operator's own button — so no trigger
    can drift on what is emitted, in what order, or under what policy. A trigger decides
    only *whether* to fold and what ``reason`` to stamp; everything past that point is
    here.

    That was not true until recently, and the one trigger sitting outside this function
    paid for it in every way a duplicated path does: it emitted neither event, so a
    hand-started fold was invisible, and it assembled its own arguments, so it ran the
    summarizer against a different input budget than an automatic fold would.

    **This never raises**, and that is a property of the function rather than a favour to
    one caller: a fold is an efficiency measure, and a turn that dies for one is worse off
    than a turn that meets the model's real ceiling. What a failure *means*, though, is the
    caller's — an automatic trigger carries on, while the operator's own button has to say
    so — which is why the outcome comes back as a value instead of being swallowed here.

    ``compaction.started`` goes out from inside the plan callback rather than before it, so
    it is emitted only once there is genuinely something to fold and can state what. It
    also refreshes the inactivity watchdog on the way past, which matters more than it

    - the dangling-call strip runs on the folded history alone, because a *retained* turn

      trailing call is answered by the very request being retried;
    - the merge runs over the **concatenation**, because the library merges consecutive
      requests when it cleans a history it is resuming, and a checkpoint hoisted in front
      of a turn that opens on a user prompt is exactly that shape. Pre-merging is what
      keeps ``all_messages()`` the length we measured our index against;
    - the boundary is then read off the two sides' *shapes*, because that merge can leave
      the turn beginning inside a message the folded history also owns. Half a message is
      still a boundary: without recording how much of it is the turn's own, the persist
      re-records the checkpoint summary — and whatever else the replay put in front of the
      prompt, the reinjected brief included — as new operator messages.
