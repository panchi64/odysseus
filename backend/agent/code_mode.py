"""``run_code`` — the model writes a script that calls tools, and only what the script
returns reaches its context.

A turn that has to read twelve files to find the three that mention something, or run a
search per item in a list, pays for every intermediate result twice: once as a round trip
and once as context the model reads and then ignores. ``pydantic_ai_harness``'s
``CodeMode`` removes both: the tools it folds become async Python functions inside a
Monty sandbox that runs **in this process**, and each call the script makes goes through
the agent's own tool stack (``ToolManager.handle_call``) — the enabled gate, the approval
gate, the describing stage, narration and every capability hook still apply to it. The
sandbox itself has no filesystem, no network and no clock; everything a script does, it
does by calling a tool. Unlike the library's default, a folded tool **stays a direct call
as well**: ``run_code`` is for a fan-out, and a single lookup is still a single call.

**Which tools a script may call is the permission level's answer, read live.** A tool is
folded only when it is still an ordinary ``function`` after ``tools/toolsets.py``'s
approval gate has marked everything the thread's level does not clear — so a tool the
level would ask about stays a direct call and parks exactly as it did before, and a
script never holds a call nobody can answer. ``CodeMode`` re-reads the catalog every step,
so a level that moves mid-conversation moves the catalog with it at the next step. Three
tools stay direct at every level (:data:`NATIVE_ONLY`): asking the operator a question,
and entering or submitting a plan — each of which ends or reshapes the turn, which a
script cannot wait on. A tool whose argument is itself a program (``code_arg_name``
metadata — ``code_execute``, the shell) stays direct by the library's own rule.

**What still has to be ruled on inside a script** is the call that gates *itself* — a
global recall, an untrusted external tool, a skill edit — which the catalog cannot see
coming. :class:`CodeModeCapability` answers those inline with the same ruling a top-level
batch gets (``agent/gating.py`` — the level, the operator's grants, Auto's review, with
the turn's own boundary and review budget); a call that would need the operator is
refused with words telling the model to call the tool directly, where it can park. A
nested call is recognised by the context it runs in: the sandbox dispatches through a
``ToolManager`` of its own whose context is the ``run_code`` call's.

**And what the operator sees.** The library streams no event for a call a script makes,
so this capability announces each one (``agent/emit.py``'s ``NestedToolStarted`` /
``NestedToolFinished``) and ``agent/translate.py`` turns them into the ordinary
``tool.*`` frames, carrying the script's ``parent_tool_call_id``. A reload rebuilds the
same rows from the record the library writes on the script's own result
(``services/conversation_view.py``).
