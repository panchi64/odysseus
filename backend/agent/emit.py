"""What a capability says on the operator's stream.

The two capabilities this codebase registers both observe a request as it is assembled —
what it weighs (``agent/overhead.py``) and which named contributor put what in front of
the model (``agent/injections.py``). Both then have to get their finding *out*, and until
Pydantic AI grew an event seam the only way was to reach through ``ctx.deps`` for the
``Run``. That made a capability — a library-owned hook, reusable by construction —
depend on our deps object, and every hook had to guard the reach in case an agent was
built without them.

Now the hook awaits ``ctx.emit`` and the event arrives in ``agent/translate.py``'s node
walk like any other, at the head of the request stream it was measured from, where it is
translated to our wire protocol in the one place that already does that translation.

**A capability's family is not a tool's.** Application code emits a ``CustomEvent`` (see
``tools/emit.py``); a capability hook emits a ``CapabilityEvent``, and emitting the wrong
family raises. That — plus the layer map, which puts ``tools`` *below* ``agent`` — is why
the two wrappers live in two files rather than one.

**And why ``runs`` does not simply subclass these.** ``runs/`` has no ``pydantic_ai``
import and should keep it that way: it is the protocol the frontend reads, and the day it
inherits from the engine is the day the wire contract moves when the engine does. The
dependency points this way — the agent layer knows about both — and not back.
