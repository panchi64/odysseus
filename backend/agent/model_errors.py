"""Reading a model provider's failure — which stop it is, and what to tell the operator.

Three of the engine's outcomes are decided here: a prompt that overran the context window
(a definitive ceiling, reported and never papered over), an inference server that couldn't
load the model (operator-actionable, engine-side), and which of *our own* per-turn budgets
tripped. All three reach the operator verbatim, so the sentences are as much a part of
this module as the classification.

**Why this isn't purely structural.** A cloud provider returns a machine-readable error
code and that is what we read. A local inference server — llama.cpp, LM Studio, vLLM,
which is what this host mostly talks to — returns prose, and there is no code to read.
So the classification is: structured signal first, prose scan second, and the prose scan
is bounded by what the HTTP status already rules out. That is honest about a heuristic we
cannot remove while local engines answer in English, and it stops the heuristic being
consulted where the provider has already told us the answer.
