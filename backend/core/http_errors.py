"""Domain errors → HTTP responses, in one table, installed app-wide.

:mod:`core.exceptions` has always said lower layers raise domain errors and the app maps
them. The mapping half never existed, so every route carried its own: 227 hand-raised
``HTTPException``\\ s, and the same error answered differently depending on which router
caught it. Anything a route *forgot* to catch became a 500 — a ``NotFoundError`` escaping
an unwrapped handler read to the client as "the server is broken" rather than "that isn't
here".

This is the table, and :func:`install_error_handlers` is where it takes effect. A route may
still catch a domain error deliberately — to say something more specific than the domain
message, or because that endpoint genuinely means something different by it. What no route
needs to do any more is restate the answer already written here.

**The statuses, and why.**

- ``NotFoundError`` → **404**. The one every store raises; ownership failures answer the
  same way deliberately (see ``core.db.get_owned``).
- ``PermissionDeniedError`` → **403**.
- ``InvalidInputError`` → **422**. The operator supplied something we can't accept; the
  form that collected it can show the message inline.
- ``DegradedCapabilityError`` → **503**. A capability is unavailable *right now* — no
  embedding endpoint bound, no browser container, no utility model. It is not the caller's
  mistake, so it is never a 4xx, and a retry after the operator wires the capability up is
  the fix. Two routes used to answer 422 here; both turned out to be raising this type for
  what was really invalid input, which is now its own error.
- ``ApprovalRequiredError`` → **409**. The action is real and permitted but needs a
  decision first.
- ``RateLimitedError`` → **429**, with ``Retry-After`` from the error's own field.
- ``SSRFError`` → **422**. The *request* named a target we refuse to reach; nothing
  upstream failed, so this is not a 502.
- ``WebFetchError`` → **502**. A genuine upstream failure fetching one URL.
- ``ModelLoadError`` → **502**. The inference server refused; the hint says what to do.
- ``SpanEditError`` (and its skill subclass) → **409**. The edit's anchor text
  didn't match exactly one span, so the write would have been ambiguous.
- ``SkillValidationError`` → **422**, carrying the offending ``field`` so the operator is
  told which part of the bundle to fix.
- ``OdysseusError`` itself has **no** entry. A base-class catch-all would quietly give a
  tidy status to errors nobody has thought about, which is how a real fault becomes an
  unnoticed 400. Anything unmapped stays a 500 and stays visible.
