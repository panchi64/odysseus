"""Server-sent events: the pump every SSE surface in the app runs on.

There is more than one live stream here — a run's frozen event stream, the durable
notification feed — and they share a framing (``id:`` seq, one flat JSON ``data:`` line,
periodic comment keepalives, ``Last-Event-ID`` resume) and, more importantly, a shape of
*machinery*: relay the source through a bounded queue, put the keepalive timeout on the
queue rather than on the source, and cancel the relay cleanly on disconnect.

What differs between surfaces is only what they stream and how one item becomes a frame.
Those are the two arguments :func:`sse_stream` takes; everything else lives here once,
because a second copy of this loop is a second place for a subtly different disconnect
path to grow.
