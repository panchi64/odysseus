"""Loopback readiness — wait for a subprocess to bind its port, and to start serving on it.

The shared probes behind every server we spawn and wait on: sandbox containers, the
managed SearXNG, the web-fetch browser, and local inference engines. No domain coupling,
so each caller wraps the outcome in its own error (``SandboxError``, ``ServingError``, …).

Two levels, because *bound* and *serving* are different facts: a dev server or an
inference engine accepts connections well before it answers a request, and a client that
takes the bind as the go-ahead gets a connection reset for its first fetch.

    A 5xx (or a connection error) is "still warming up"; anything below 5xx means the
    server is serving, including a 404 — the probe usually hits a path the server has no
    route for, and being answered at all is the fact we want.

    Returns ``False`` on running out of budget rather than raising, because the two
    callers disagree about what a timeout means: an engine that never became ready is a
    failed start, while a sandbox preview that hasn't answered yet is still worth opening
    (the operator's refresh button is the backstop). Neither reading belongs here.

    ``is_alive`` behaves as in :func:`await_listening` — when the process being waited on
    has already exited, raise ``ConnectionError`` at once instead of polling a port that
    will never answer. Each request and each sleep is clamped to the remaining budget, so
    the call never overshoots ``timeout_s`` even when a probe hangs.
