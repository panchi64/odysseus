"""A small in-memory token-bucket rate limiter — the shared throttle substrate.

One process, one operator: a flood of requests (uploads, `UP-4`) is a runaway loop
or a stuck client, not contention between users, so an in-memory token bucket keyed
by an arbitrary string is the right grain — no Redis, no cross-process coordination.
A bucket holds up to ``burst`` tokens and refills at ``rate_per_second`` tokens a
second; each allowed action spends one. When the bucket is dry the limiter reports
how long until the next token so the caller can surface a ``Retry-After``.

Deliberately generic so any endpoint that needs throttling reuses it rather than
re-implementing the bucket. The clock is injectable so behavior is testable without
sleeping.
