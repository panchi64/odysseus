"""One recurring background job — the loop every reaper and sweeper in the app was
writing for itself.

Three of them existed before this file and they were the same fifteen lines three times:
create a task in ``start``, cancel-suppress-await it in ``stop``, and loop over
``sleep(interval)`` → ``try: work() except Exception: log``. Nothing was wrong with any
copy; what was wrong is that the rule holding them together — **a bad sweep must never kill
the loop** — was a comment repeated per copy rather than a property of one thing, so a
fourth copy could quietly omit it and nobody would be looking at the other three.

What it owns is deliberately only the task. A caller's own teardown stays the caller's: the
browser manager tears down every live session after its loop stops, the sandbox manager
drains its in-flight teardowns and shuts its containers, and neither of those belongs to a
timer. :meth:`stop` puts the loop down and returns.

**The interval is slept first, never last.** Every user of this wants "every N seconds from
now", not "at boot and then every N seconds": a reaper that sweeps on start does its work
against a process with nothing in it yet, and a summariser that did would run the moment the
app comes up against every thread at once. ``first_delay_s`` overrides the first sleep for
the caller that genuinely wants a different lead-in.

**The task scheduler is deliberately not on this** (:mod:`services.scheduler`). It looks
like a fourth copy and is not one: it sleeps to the *earliest due task*, recomputed after
every tick and interruptible by a wake, so its period is a property of the data rather than
a constant. Folding a due-time queue into a fixed-interval timer would mean either polling
far more often than it needs to or firing tasks late, which is two algorithms forced into
one shape for the sake of sharing a ``try/except``. Conversation titling is not one either,
for the opposite reason: it runs once, inside the turn it belongs to, with no loop at all.

It lives here and not beside :class:`harness.LifecycleRegistry`, which is where every one
of its users registers it, because the pairing is the *caller's* and not this module's: a
service imports the timer, while the registry is held one layer up by whoever assembles the
app. Putting the primitive in ``harness`` would have meant services importing the assembly
layer — the one direction ``harness/__init__`` says nothing may go — to gain a class that
imports nothing above ``logging``. Its neighbours here are the right ones:
:mod:`core.worker` is the same idea for a drained queue, and :mod:`core.concurrency` for a
bounded fan-out.
