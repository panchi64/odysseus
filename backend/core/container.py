"""A typed service container — capability handles keyed by concrete class.

The one shape used everywhere a capability is looked up rather than imported:
feature manifests resolve their cross-feature dependencies from the harness's
container, and the agent's tools reach their capabilities through the run's bag
(``RunDeps.caps``). Lives in ``core`` so every layer above can share it without
a cycle.
