"""Operator authentication and the global auth gate.

Single operator: the password both verifies login and derives the encryption key
(through the vault). :class:`AuthManager` tracks issued session tokens; they live
in memory and are cleared on lock or restart — which is also when the vault
re-locks, so a valid token always implies an unlocked vault.

Alongside that session there is a second, *programmatic* way in: a scoped API token
(`AUTH-4`), issued to a client and presented as a bearer credential. The two are told apart
by the token's own shape (``odyt_``), and they differ in reach — a session is the operator
and may do anything, while a token may only touch the surfaces its scopes claim
(``core.api_scopes``, deny-by-default). Both are throttled through one shared attempt
limiter (`AUTH-1`), keyed per client, so guessing either credential is rate-bound.

:class:`AuthMiddleware` is a **pure ASGI** middleware (not BaseHTTPMiddleware) so
it never buffers responses — important for the SSE event stream. It enforces the
gate before any feature is reached and passes streaming responses through
untouched.
