"""Outbound-request guard against server-side request forgery (SSRF).

Any URL the agent hands us to fetch is untrusted: left unchecked it could point at
the loopback interface, the private LAN, or a cloud instance-metadata endpoint and
turn the backend into a confused deputy. Before any outbound fetch — and again on
every redirect hop — the target host is resolved and every resulting address is
checked; if any is non-public the request is refused.

Platform-agnostic: pure stdlib (``socket`` + ``ipaddress``), no OS-specific facility.

    DNS resolution runs in a thread (``getaddrinfo`` is blocking). Call this for
    the initial URL *and* for each redirect ``Location`` before following it — a
    public host can redirect to a private one (open-redirect).

    Known limitation — DNS rebinding: this validates the addresses ``getaddrinfo``
    returns now, but the HTTP client re-resolves the host when it connects, so a
    low-TTL attacker domain could return a public IP here and a private one at
    connect time. Fully closing this needs the connection pinned to the validated
    IP (a custom resolver/transport); until then the guard stops the direct and
