"""Sources a tool result carries.

Some tool results are *about* places a claim could be checked — a search's hits, a fetched
page, a passage out of the operator's own knowledge base — and the run stream surfaces
those as citations so the answer can show its sources. The question is who knows which
results those are.

Not the event translator. It sits in Pillar II, turning the library's run into our
protocol, and a translator that matches on ``"web_search"`` and imports
``services.search`` has to be edited every time a feature grows a tool that cites
something — and knows about a feature's own types to do it. So the result type declares
its own sources instead: anything with a ``citations()`` method is citable, and the
translator asks rather than recognizes.

**A source is not only a URL.** The corpus is a first-class place to have read something,
and a citation that could only be a web address left a research thread reading the
operator's own files showing no sources for them at all. So a citation carries a ``kind``
and an identity (:attr:`Citation.key`) that a corpus passage can satisfy as well as a page
can.

**And "cited" is not one thing.** A search returns ten hits; the model read the snippets
of all ten, opened two, and wrote its answer from one. Emitting the same event for all
three cases makes "cited" mean no more than "a tool returned it", which is what
:class:`Engagement` exists to fix: ``listed`` < ``read`` < ``cited``, and a source the run
meets twice is emitted twice — once per rung it reaches. Consumers fold by
:attr:`Citation.key` and keep the highest rung, which is why the rung is on the wire and
the ladder's order is stated here rather than inferred.

What is deliberately *not* here is a link from a source to the sentence it supports. That
link exists now — it is :mod:`services.attributions` and :mod:`agent.attribution` — and it
lives there rather than here for the reason it has to: it is not something a tool result
can declare. A tool knows what it returned; only a reader of the *finished answer* knows
what the answer ended up resting on, and that reading happens after the turn. What this
module gained from it is the ``cited`` rung finally having a producer.
