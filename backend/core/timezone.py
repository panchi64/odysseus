"""Which zone the operator lives in — asked once, answered from the host.

Odysseus runs on the operator's own machine, so their clock *is* the host's clock. That
sounds like it needs no module, until three callers need the answer in three shapes: the
standing brief wants a name to tell the model, the calendar wants an IANA key it can put
on a row, and neither wants to care that a host can be configured in more than one way.

Three sources, in the order a POSIX host means them:

1. ``TZ`` — an explicit override the operator (or the service manager) set. Where it
   names a zone, it is the answer: everything else on the host is already reading it.
2. ``/etc/localtime`` — on Linux and macOS alike this is a symlink into the tz database,
   and the path tail after ``zoneinfo/`` is the IANA key. This is the common case, and the
   only source that yields a *name* rather than a number.
3. The current UTC offset, as ``UTC±HH:MM``. A last resort: a container with a copied
   rather than linked ``/etc/localtime`` has a real offset and no name to give it, and an
   offset is still worth more to a model reasoning about "tomorrow morning" than nothing.

``TZ`` is a small language rather than a name, and the three spellings POSIX allows are
the reason this module exists at all. A leading colon is permitted and means nothing; an
*empty* value means UTC rather than "unset"; and the value may be a path into the tz
database or a rule string like ``CET-1CEST,M3.5.0`` that names no zone at all. Handing
any of those back verbatim is how the two callers end up describing different clocks —
the brief saying Madrid while the calendar, unable to build a ``ZoneInfo`` from it, files
events in UTC.

**Never raises, and never validates a key it does give back.** A caller that needs one it
can construct a ``ZoneInfo`` from still checks that itself — a zone the tz database
rejects is a different problem from a host that will not say what zone it is in, and the
fallback for one is not the fallback for the other.
