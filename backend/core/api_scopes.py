"""The scope catalog for inbound API tokens (`AUTH-4`).

A scope is a **named group of API surfaces**, not a permission bit: the operator issuing a
token picks the capabilities it may reach ("chat", "knowledge"), and the gate resolves the
request path back to the scope that owns it. Path prefixes are the grain because the HTTP
surface *is* the capability boundary here — each router owns exactly one feature — so the
mapping needs no per-route annotation and can't silently drift as routes are added within a
surface.

Core owns the **vocabulary** (`SCOPE_DEFS` — the operator-facing groups) and the
**machinery** (`ScopeTable`); the *claims* mapping prefixes into a scope arrive at app
assembly — `CORE_CLAIMS` for the surfaces core itself wires, plus each feature manifest's
own claims — so core never has to know which features exist.

Three rules make it safe:

* **Longest prefix wins.** ``/models/serving`` resolves to the ``serving`` scope, not the
  broader ``models`` one, so bringing model servers up and down is grantable on its own.
* **A claim may narrow to read methods.** Where one prefix covers both reading a surface
  and reconfiguring it, the claim says which methods it means, so a scope described to the
  operator as read-only cannot be spent on a write.
* **Deny by default.** A path no claim covers is unreachable with a token, whatever scopes
  it carries. That is deliberate for the surfaces that claim nothing — ``/auth``,
  ``/setup``, ``/tokens``, ``/credentials``, ``/vault``, ``/backup``, ``/shell``, mail,
  calendar, external tools — so a token can never mint another token, read the operator's
  secrets, or reach the host. Widening a token's reach is an explicit claim, an act,
  rather than a side effect of adding a router.
