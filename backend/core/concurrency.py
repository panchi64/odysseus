"""Bounded fan-out.

Several places in the backend have the same shape: a list of independent awaitables that
should run concurrently, but not *all* concurrently — a mail listing's per-message
fetches, a reaper's per-session teardowns. Unbounded
``asyncio.gather`` over a page of remote calls is a burst the far side may rate-limit;
running them one at a time turns one round trip into fifty.

The cap is the caller's to choose, because what it protects differs: an API's rate limit,
a browser's memory, a disk. This module owns only the plumbing.
