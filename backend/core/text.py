"""Tiny text/token utilities shared across layers.

There is no exact tokenizer at the points these are used (conversation compaction's
footprint estimate, the context readout's split, the summarizer's input budget), and the
budgets they serve are *soft*, so a coarse characters-per-token proxy is good enough to
bound sizes deterministically. Kept here, in the foundation layer, so every caller shares
one estimate, not several — the gauge and the trigger have to agree about how full a
thread is, and they only do if they divide by the same numbers.

:func:`replace_unique` is here for the same reason: surgical editing is the shape of both
``DOC-2`` and ``SKILL-3``, and one implementation of "replace exactly one span or refuse"
means both surfaces refuse identically. So is :func:`strip_think_blocks` — every utility
model call that asks for reasoning off has to survive a runtime that ignores the lever.

# A coarse characters≈tokens proxy, for turning a *token* budget back into a character
# one (`tokens_to_chars`). Deliberately the pessimistic member of the pair below: a
# budget converted at 4 asks for fewer characters than the content will actually fit, and
# a soft budget that under-fills is a budget nothing overflows.
CHARS_PER_TOKEN = 4

#: Characters per token, by content kind — measured against cl100k on representative
#: samples and pinned by `tests/test_context_estimator_calibration.py`.
#:
#: Two rates rather than one because the difference between them is load-bearing wherever
#: prose and serialized structure are *compared*: JSON spends about a third of its
#: characters on punctuation and short repeated keys, so it tokenizes denser than prose,
#: and a shared divisor leaves the prose parts inflated by roughly a fifth against the
#: JSON ones. On a tool-heavy thread that is the difference between "your tools are the
#: problem" and "your conversation is" — and, since the same numbers drive the compaction
#: trigger, between folding a thread and letting it overflow.
#:
#: They live here, beside `CHARS_PER_TOKEN`, because every measurement in the codebase
#: has to answer with the same number: the context readout's split, the footprint the
#: compaction trigger projects, and the gauge the operator reads are one estimate seen
#: three ways, and three private copies of these constants would eventually disagree.
#:
#: Code sits between the two (~4.3) and is counted as prose, since it arrives as a string.
#: That over-credits a thread of pasted source by around a tenth, which is inside the
#: tolerance a `~` readout claims and well short of the error a shared divisor produces.
