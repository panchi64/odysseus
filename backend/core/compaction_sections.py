"""The compaction summary's section contract, as a parser.

``prompts/utility.py`` asks the summarizer for eight fixed headings, and that roster is a
**parsed contract rather than a style guide**: the carry-forward reads `Anchors` out of it
verbatim, and `fence_tool_facts` uses it to decide where the untrusted fence closes. Both
of those, and the operator's own transcript, need the same answer to "what are this
checkpoint's sections" — so the parse lives here, once, below everything that wants it.

**Why this is a separate module from the code that produces summaries.**
``agent/compaction_summary.py`` imports ``services.conversation_view``, so anything in
``services`` (the conversation projection, which renders a checkpoint on a cold read) could
not import the parser back from ``agent`` without a cycle. This module imports only
``prompts.utility`` and ``core.untrusted``, both leaves, so the producer, the live event and
the cold-read projection can all reach it.

**The roster is a security boundary, not a convenience.** The summarizer is asked to quote
its sources, so a fetched page's own ``## Notes for the assistant`` arrives inside the
summary looking exactly like a heading. Only a heading naming one of *our* sections ends a
section; anything else is body text wherever it appears. Getting that wrong closes the
untrusted fence early and leaves whatever followed it stored as the workspace's own voice,
which is the injection the fence exists to stop.
