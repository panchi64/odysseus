"""Splitting a markdown file's YAML frontmatter from the body underneath it.

Two file formats this codebase reads open with the same ``---`` block and mean entirely
different things below it: a skill's ``SKILL.md``, and an agent definition a project
declares for its own sub-agents. Neither cares *how* the fence is found, and both were
going to get the same twenty lines — a BOM strip, a fence match that must be a whole line,
a ``yaml.safe_load`` that has to be told a stream of ``None`` is an empty mapping, and a
body whose leading newlines are an artifact of the fence rather than content.

So the finding lives here, once, and the *meaning* lives with each format. What a field is
called, whether it is required and what it may hold are the caller's business; this module
answers only "is there a frontmatter block, and what is in it".

Deliberately not a validator. It raises on a file that is not of this shape at all, and
says nothing about a file that is — a caller that wanted a missing key to be fatal and one
that wanted it defaulted are both right, and neither is decidable from here.
