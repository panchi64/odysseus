"""How long to wait before retry number *n*.

Two retriers in the backend independently spelled out ``base * 2 ** (attempt - 1)``: the
write-behind worker draining a queue, and the model downloader re-running a failed pull.
The formula is short enough to retype, which is exactly why it drifted out of one place —
and it is the natural home for anything that later applies to *all* retries here (a
ceiling, jitter, a different curve), so it should only exist once.

No jitter, deliberately. Jitter exists to decorrelate many clients retrying against one
service; this is a single-operator host where each retrier is the only one on its queue,
so a random delay would buy nothing and make a failing path harder to reason about.
