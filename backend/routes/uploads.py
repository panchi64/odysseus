"""Uploads surface — accept files, expose their extracted text, serve them back.

Thin pass-throughs to :class:`~services.uploads.UploadStore`: list/get, upload (a
multipart file), download the original bytes, correct the extracted text, retry a
failed extraction, and delete. Content (filename, extracted text) is returned
decrypted — the operator owns it. Out-shapes are camelCase to match the frontend's
``uploads`` seam. File *search* is not here — it flows through ``/corpus`` like every
other source, once a file's text is extracted.

Two protections live at this layer (`UP-1`/`UP-4`), where transport concerns belong:
a per-operator rate limit on the upload endpoint, and a single-file size cap. Duplicate
*recognition* is the store's job; this layer only reports it (200 vs 201).
