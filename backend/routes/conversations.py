"""Conversations surface — browse, read, rename, and delete chat threads.

Thin pass-throughs to the :class:`ConversationStore`. Creating a conversation is
a chat concern (``POST /chat`` does it as a side effect of starting a turn); this
router only reads and manages the threads that already exist. History is returned
as a render-ready projection — the durable record stays full-fidelity
``ModelMessage`` blobs; the frontend never sees those.
