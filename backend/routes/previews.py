"""Live-preview reverse proxy — the token-gated window into a sandbox server.

The agent runs a dev server in its sandbox (``start_preview``); this forwards the
operator's browser to it. The address carries an unguessable per-preview **token**
(``/previews/{token}/…``) which *is* the credential, and the token rides every
relative subresource load automatically. So this subtree is exempt from the cookie
gate (see ``core/auth``) — it only ever proxies to a loopback preview container,
never to operator data. It is *not* exempt from the vault-locked gate: locking takes
the preview offline with everything else.

The opaque origin the frontend's sandboxed iframe provides is also enforced here, as a
``Content-Security-Policy: sandbox`` without ``allow-same-origin`` on every proxied
response — so agent-authored HTML is isolated from the API origin however it is opened,
not only when the frontend happens to frame it correctly.

Both legs are byte-transparent: HTTP via a streaming ``httpx`` proxy, WebSocket via
a ``websockets`` bridge (so Vite/HMR live-reload works). The operator's credentials
are never forwarded inward, and the preview can't set cookies on the API origin.

# operator's session. `sandbox` *without* `allow-same-origin` puts the document in an
# opaque origin — no cookies, no credentialed same-origin fetch — while leaving a dev
# server fully functional. `routes/views.py` makes the same call for the same reason; the
# frontend's iframe attributes are UX, not the enforcement point.
