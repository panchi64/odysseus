"""Password vault — the operator's secrets manager (`VAULT-1..2`).

Distinct from ``core/vault``: that is the password-derived at-rest key custody that unlocks
the app at login. This is the user-facing place to keep credentials, with its own lock. The
module is named ``secret_vault`` rather than ``vault`` so ``app.py`` can import it plainly
alongside its local ``vault`` handle on the key custody — same reason the ``deps`` accessor
is ``secret_vault()``.

See ``routes/mail.py`` for why the surface is registered before it exists.

Thin, like every router: it parses, calls ``services/secret_vault``, and maps that layer's
domain errors to status codes — **423** for a locked vault (the code the auth gate already
uses for a locked app, which the frontend client treats as "re-authenticate"), 409 for a
configure/unlock precondition, 404 for an unknown entry.

Unlock is not separately rate-limited: every attempt pays two Argon2id hashes (the verifier
check, then the key derivation), which *is* the brute-force cost — the same reasoning that
protects the login vault.
