"""Mail surface (`EMAIL-1..5`) — the Email screen's REST contract.

Thin pass-throughs to :class:`~services.mail.service.MailService`; every decision the
screen appears to make (what's urgent, what's spam, which folder is Sent, whether a
provider supports a move) was already made below this layer. Out-shapes are camelCase to
match the frontend's ``email`` seam, and message bodies come back decrypted — the operator
owns their own mail.

Two things are deliberately *not* here:

- **No approval gate on sending.** An operator pressing SEND in their own client has
  already consented; the gate belongs on the *agent's* tool (``tools/mail.py``, `AE-3.1`),
  which is a different actor asking for a different thing.
- **No untrusted fencing.** Fencing is for content on its way into a *model's* context
  (`XC-SEC-5`). This content is on its way to a human reading their own inbox, where a
  fence would be noise.

Domain errors map here rather than leaking: a missing account/message is 404, a rejected
credential is 401, an unreachable provider is 503 (the caller retries or reads the cache),
an unsupported operation is 409, and anything else the operator can act on is 400.
