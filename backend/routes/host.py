"""Host surface — the two things the operator's own machine does that a browser can't.

Reading a path off the desktop, and acting on one. A browser can do neither: ``<input
type="file">`` hands over bytes with no location, and ``file://`` navigation is blocked
from a page. Both are done by the process running on the operator's machine, so the
chooser's answer comes back as data and the opener's argument goes out as data.

Progressive enhancement, never a requirement. ``GET /host/file-picker`` reports whether
this host can open a chooser at all, and every surface that offers a BROWSE control also
takes a typed path; a host with no opener answers ``POST /host/open`` with a sentence
saying so, and the path is still there to read in the prose that named it.

Both halves are **agent-unreachable by construction** — see ``services/host_picker`` and
``services/host_open`` for the platform helpers and the rule.
