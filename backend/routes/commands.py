"""The command catalog, and the workflows the operator writes into it.

Two surfaces on one router, because they are two views of the same noun. ``GET /commands``
is what a composer reads — thin over :class:`~services.commands.registry.CommandRegistry`,
and everything it appears to decide was decided below this layer: which commands exist,
which of them this thread can actually honour, which one wins a shared name, and what the
headings are called. ``/commands/workflows`` is the editor for the one source the registry
owns, and touches nothing the other four provide.

**The groups ride the catalog response.** A client that kept its own heading list would show
a blank section the first time a source was added below it, so the labels come down with the
rows.

**Validation errors name their field**, matching ``skills``: the message reaches the editor
as a 422 whose detail it renders verbatim, because the backend decides what is valid and the
frontend only shows it. camelCase out, the same way.

    absent rather than shipped and then refused — that part is presence. It is also what
