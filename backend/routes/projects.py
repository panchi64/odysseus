"""The projects surface — the operator's working directories and the active selection.

Thin over `services/projects`. Two shapes deserve a note:

`repo` on every listing is **probed live**, not stored. Whether a directory is a git
repository, and how many changes are uncommitted, are facts about the world that change
without us; caching them would mean showing the operator a stale answer to the one
question that decides whether code mode is safe to start.

`uncommittedChanges` is surfaced deliberately, and the UI is expected to show it. Code
mode branches a worktree from the project's base ref, so uncommitted work in the
operator's own tree is **invisible to the agent**. That is the price of never touching
their tree, and it should be read on the project screen rather than discovered halfway
through a session.

camelCase out, matching the `corpus`/`uploads`/`tasks` surfaces the frontend
seams were built against.
