"""The code branch surface — review what a code conversation changed, then land it.

A code thread works on `ody/<conversation-id>` in a worktree beside the project, never
in the operator's own checkout. These three endpoints are how that work gets back:

- ``GET /worktrees/{conversation_id}`` — the diffstat, the patch, the **per-file rows with
  their risk verdict**, and how far the branch has drifted from the project's base ref.
- ``POST .../merge`` — **the one operation that writes the operator's tree**. It is not
  approval-gated in the agent sense because it cannot be: the agent never calls it. The
  operator pressing MERGE *is* the approval, which is why this is a route and not a tool.
- ``POST .../discard`` — throw the branch away.

Keyed by conversation rather than by branch name, because that is what the operator is
looking at when they decide. camelCase out, matching the projects surface beside it.
