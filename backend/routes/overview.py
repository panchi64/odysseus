"""Home overview — a read-only aggregate of real chassis status.

The home page is presentation-only; this endpoint is the single source of truth
it renders. It reports what the backend actually knows: the build version, which
model roles are configured, whether the execution sandbox is present, and counts
of the operator's conversations, memories, and configured endpoints — plus the
capability health derived from those facts (the policy lives here, not in the
frontend). Telemetry and external services that don't exist yet are simply
absent rather than fabricated; they grow rows here as their capabilities land.
