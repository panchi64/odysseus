"""Backup & restore (`BACKUP-1..2`).

See ``routes/mail.py`` for why the surface is registered before it exists.

The export comes back as the envelope **JSON object** rather than a file download: the whole
format is already a single JSON document, and returning it as a normal response lets the
browser client save it with the bytes it has in hand — no second auth-gated content endpoint,
no download token. Import takes the same object back.

A wrong backup secret answers **400**, never 401/423: those two codes mean *the session*
failed app-wide (the frontend client clears the token on either), and mistyping a recovery
passphrase is not that.
