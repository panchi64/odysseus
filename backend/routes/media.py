"""Remote-image proxy — the one way a picture from the open web reaches an answer.

An answer's Markdown can carry an image (see ``prompts.agent``), but the frontend
never points an ``<img>`` at the remote URL: it points here, same-origin, and this
route fetches the bytes through :mod:`services.webimage`. That is the whole purpose —
an ``<img>`` fetches on render with no click, so pointing one at a host named by
relayed page content would leak the operator's address, user-agent, and cookies to
that host silently. One hop through the backend removes all three.

The bytes are served **inert**, on the same principle as ``/views``: a sniffed content
type (never the remote's claim), ``nosniff``, a no-privileges CSP, and an attachment
disposition, so a response that turns out to be something other than the picture it
claimed cannot become a document with a foothold on the API origin.
