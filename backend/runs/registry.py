"""Pillar I — the RunRegistry: launch, track, bound, and cancel Runs.

In-process: Runs are asyncio tasks tracked in a dict, gated by a **per-lane**
concurrency semaphore (bursts queue at the gate — the ``queued`` state, which
also prevents overlapping overload). Which lane a run waits in follows from its
``kind`` — see ``runs/lanes.py`` for why the operator's own turn does not share a
pool with unattended work. The registry owns the lifecycle mechanics —
queued→running, the terminal-state mapping, the wall-clock + inactivity bounds,
and cancellation — so every orchestrator inherits them for free.
