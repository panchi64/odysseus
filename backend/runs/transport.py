"""Pillar I/II — SSE transport: turn a Run's event stream into an HTTP response.

The only transport in v1 (SSE for server→client, POST for control). Disconnect
is safe — the generator just unsubscribes; the Run keeps executing and is fully
replayable on reconnect via ``Last-Event-ID``.

The pump itself — bounded relay queue, keepalive comments, clean cancellation — is
``core.sse``, shared with the notification feed. What belongs here is the one thing
specific to a run: which stream to subscribe to, and that an ``Event`` already knows how
to render itself as a frame.
