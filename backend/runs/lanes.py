"""Which queue a run waits in.

One pool of eight slots shared by everything was a bound on the *host*, not a policy
about *whose work matters*: a scheduled task firing at nine and two research threads the
agent opened for itself could hold every slot, and the operator's next message sat at the
gate behind them — queued, silent, and indistinguishable from a slow model.

So the pool is **carved into lanes** rather than replaced by them: the host ceiling stays
one semaphore, and each lane holds a second, narrower one that caps how much of that
ceiling its kind of work may take. A run picks its lane from its own ``kind``, which is
the whole mechanism — no call site threads a new argument, because every submitter
already says what kind of work it is submitting.

**Lanes redistribute the ceiling; they never raise it.** Two semaphores rather than one
per lane because the alternative — a pool per lane — makes the machine's real limit the
*sum* of the lanes, which is how a change meant to lower resource use quietly raises peak
concurrency instead. The operator's protection does not come from a bigger pool: it comes
from the unattended lanes being capped well below the ceiling, so slots they can never
hold are, by arithmetic, always there for a turn somebody is waiting on.

**The lanes are about who is waiting, not what the run does.** All three kinds run the
same chat orchestrator over the same tools; they differ in whether somebody is sitting in
front of the answer. ``interactive`` is the operator's own turn and gets the widest lane.
``background`` is unattended work — a scheduled task, whose whole point is that nobody is
watching it. ``linked`` is a thread the agent opened for itself (research started from
another conversation), which is foreground for the model and background for the operator,
and gets its own lane so a burst of them can neither starve the operator nor be starved
by the scheduler.

An unrecognised kind lands in ``background``. That is the conservative direction: a kind
nobody mapped is far more likely to be new autonomous work than a turn the operator is
waiting on, and the one thing this module exists to prevent is unattended work crowding
out attended work.
