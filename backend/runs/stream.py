"""Pillar I — the per-run event stream: in-memory buffer + broker.

One :class:`RunStream` per Run owns the sequence-numbered event buffer and the
set of live subscribers. It does two jobs at once:

- **buffer** — every event is appended in ``seq`` order and kept for the run's
  lifetime, so a client that disconnects and reconnects can replay what it
  missed on reconnect.
- **broker** — each emit fans out to every live subscriber's queue.

The buffer is in-memory and dies with the process, which the spec explicitly
licenses ("continuity need not survive a server restart").

Correctness note: ``emit`` is synchronous and ``subscribe`` does its
register-then-snapshot with no ``await`` in between. Under single-threaded
asyncio that window is atomic, so every event lands in exactly one of {backlog,
live queue} — no gap, no duplicate, for any subscriber at any time.

Backpressure: each subscriber queue is bounded. A consumer that stops draining
(a stalled or wedged client) is dropped rather than allowed to grow without
limit — it can reconnect with ``Last-Event-ID`` and replay the gap from the
buffer, so dropping it is lossless, not data loss.
