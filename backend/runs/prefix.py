"""What a model request's cacheable prefix looked like, and where the last one stopped
matching it.

Every inference engine worth caching against — llama.cpp's per-slot longest-common-prefix,
vLLM's chained block hashes, OpenAI's single implicit breakpoint — reuses a request's
leading tokens only while they are **byte-identical** to what it saw before, and re-reads
everything from the first difference onward. So the question "why did that turn take
fourteen seconds to start" almost always has a structural answer: something near the front
of the request moved, and the whole history behind it was re-read at full price.

That answer is not visible from any figure we already collect. ``ttft_ms`` says a request
was slow; ``cache_read_tokens`` is ``None`` on every local server; the composition readout
says what the brief *weighed*, not whether it was the **same** brief. This module is the
missing half: a fingerprint of each request's prefix, and a verdict on how far the previous
one still matched.

Sits in ``runs`` rather than beside the code that computes it (``agent.prefix_watch``) for
the reason :mod:`runs.overhead` does: the :class:`~runs.run.Run` carries one across a turn
and ``runs`` cannot import from ``agent``. The comparison is the agent layer's; the value is
the run's.

**Digests, never copies.** A prefix fingerprint outlives the request it describes — the
ledger below holds one per conversation for the life of the process, and a turn parked for
approval holds its own for as long as the operator takes to answer. Retaining the text would
pin a copy of every brief and every replayed history for that whole time, a repo brief alone
being budgeted at 16 KB. Sixteen bytes per block answers the only question a fingerprint is
asked: is this the same as last time. Tool *names* are the one exception and are kept in
full — they are a fixed vocabulary this codebase authored, they are what makes "the model
revealed the browser group" legible instead of "the tool array changed", and they are not
anybody's content.

#: How the head of a request moved since the last one. The head is the brief and the tool
#: array — everything an engine sees *before* the first message — and on llama.cpp, vLLM and
#: the OpenAI API alike a change anywhere in it invalidates the entire history behind it,
#: because each has a single monotone cache boundary rather than the additive breakpoints
#: Anthropic exposes. That is why this is one verdict over the whole head rather than a
#: per-block cost: the blocks do not pay separately.
HeadChange = Literal["first", "none", "instructions", "tools", "both"]

#: The *shape* of the first mismatch in the message list, which is what says whether a
#: divergence was expected. Named rather than numeric because the index alone cannot
#: distinguish the per-turn-boundary cost this codebase has accepted from a bug:
#:
#: - ``first`` — nothing to compare against; this is the conversation's first measured request.
#: - ``append`` — every message previously sent is still there, byte for byte, with more after
#:   it. The ideal: only the new part is read. Every step *within* a turn should be this.
#: - ``tail`` — exactly the previously-last message changed, and the history continued past
#:   it. The per-turn-boundary divergence the tail-context seam accepts by design: turn N's
#:   request ends with the volatile context appended to the operator's prompt, and turn N+1
#:   replays that prompt without it. Bounded at one turn's assistant work, and it does not
#:   grow with thread length.
#: - ``clean_drop`` — the current history is a strict prefix of the previous one. A rewind, a
#:   regenerate or an edit. Costs nothing: a shorter matching prefix is still a matching prefix.
#: - ``fold`` — the divergence is at or beside the head of the history and the history shrank.
#:   Compaction. A full re-read, and the price of the room it bought.
#: - ``rewrite`` — the divergence is strictly inside the history, with the history continuing
#:   past it. Nothing in this codebase should produce one; a history processor that edited an
#:   earlier turn would. (The design note this was drafted against called this case
#:   ``dangling``, after the dangling tool round trip that motivated it — renamed because the
#:   shape is what is observable here and a dangling call is only one way to reach it.)
#: - ``unknown`` — a shape none of the above describes. Kept so the classifier can be honest
#:   rather than forcing every reading into a bucket.
DivergenceKind = Literal[
    "first", "append", "tail", "clean_drop", "fold", "rewrite", "unknown"
]

#: How many conversations' fingerprints the ledger keeps. One entry is a few hundred bytes
#: (a digest per replayed message), so this is a bound on nothing that matters; what it
#: actually prevents is a process that has served ten thousand threads holding a fingerprint
#: for each. Generous enough that the threads an operator is switching between all stay warm,
#: which is the only case the cross-turn reading needs.
