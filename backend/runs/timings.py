"""Wall-clock instrumentation for a turn — how long the model took, how long its
tools took, and how long the operator waited for the first token.

**Measured here, on our side of the wire, and never read off a provider.** The
numbers have to mean the same thing whether the turn ran on Anthropic, on an
OpenAI-compatible endpoint, or on a local engine — and providers disagree about
what they report, when, and whether they report it at all. A stopwatch around our
own node iteration is the one measurement every endpoint can be held to, so that
is what this is: `time.monotonic` deltas around the two graph nodes the
translator already walks.

That choice sets what the numbers include, and the inclusion is deliberate.
``llm_ms`` is the full round-trip — connect, queue, generate, stream — because
that is the wait the operator actually sat through; it is not a claim about the
provider's own inference time, which we cannot see. ``ttft_ms`` is measured to
the *first emitted part of any kind* — reasoning and tool calls included, not just
answer text. On a thinking model the first thing to arrive is a thinking delta, and
timing to the first answer token instead would report the model's entire reasoning
pass as latency.

That breadth is also what makes throughput correct downstream. TTFT is the
non-generating head of a request (connect, queue, prefill), so the decode rate is
output tokens over ``llm_ms - ttft_ms``. A response that reported no first token
would contribute its whole prefill to the generating side of that subtraction, which
is why even a bare tool call — which this module never otherwise sees — has to mark
one. See ``RunMetrics.output_tokens_per_second``.

The one number here that isn't a stopwatch is the cache hit — that can only come
from provider-reported usage (``cache_read_tokens``), so it is absent, never
zero, for the many endpoints that don't report it. See ``RunMetrics``.
