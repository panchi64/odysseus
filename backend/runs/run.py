"""Pillar I — the Run: one identified, background-executing unit of work.

Chat turns, agent tasks, and research jobs are all Runs; they differ only in
the orchestrator that drives them. A Run owns its id/owner/status, its event
stream (buffer + broker), and — once running — the asyncio task executing it.
Status follows ``queued → running → {done | blocked | error | cancelled}``,
with a parked ``awaiting_input`` when a sensitive action needs approval.
