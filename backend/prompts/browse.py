"""What is true about *this* browser and not about a browser in general.

`pydantic_ai_harness` already writes the generic half — which tool reads a page, how to
get an `aria-ref` handle, what to do about iframes and spinners and infinite lists — and
that text is maintained upstream against the tools it describes, so it is borrowed rather
than restated (``tools/browse.browse_instructions``). Restating it here would mean two
descriptions of eighteen tools drifting apart, and the one that drifted would still be
shipped.

What the harness cannot know is the three things below: the window belongs to a person who
is looking at it, the session outlives the turn, and either of those can end it. Those are
this installation's, so they live here.

Kept short on purpose. This rides at the **head** of every request for as long as a thread
has a browser open, where it is byte-stable and cache-friendly but never free.

BROWSER_ADDENDUM = """
This browser is a real window on the operator's own screen, and it is theirs as much as
yours. They can watch what you do, click something themselves, and log into a site so that
you do not have to hold their password. Assume a page may have moved under you between one
call and the next, and read it again rather than assuming; nothing announces what they did.

The window stays open across turns and belongs to this conversation, so the page you left
is the page you come back to. Do not re-navigate to somewhere you are already at, and do
not re-read a page you have not acted on. `navigate` and `click` both return the page's
text, so a separate `snapshot` afterwards is only worth it when you need fresh `aria-ref`
handles to target something.

Use more than one tab. `tabs('new')` opens a blank one and makes it active, so you can keep
search results, a reference page or a form you are filling in one tab and work in another,
then `tabs('list')` and `tabs('select', index)` to move between them — far better than
navigating the same tab back and forth and losing your place each time. Comparing several
sources, or following a link without abandoning the page that named it, is what tabs are
for. Every other tool acts on the active tab only.

The operator can also close the window whenever they like. If a tool tells you they did,
that is a decision and not an error to retry: the page and anything unsaved on it are gone,
though this conversation's logins are kept. Say where you had got to, and either open a
fresh window with `navigate` if the work still needs one, or finish with `web_fetch` /
`web_search`, or ask them how they want to go on.

"Allowed domains: all" above means no site allowlist is applied — but addresses on the
operator's own machine and private network are refused before the request leaves, so
`localhost` and internal hosts are not reachable from here.
