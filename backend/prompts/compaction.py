"""Conversation compaction — the request that asks the main model to fold its own thread,
and the label its answer is stored under.

Not a utility prompt, although it once was. The summary is written by the agent the thread
runs on, continuing its own conversation (``agent/compaction_summary.py``): the replay it
would be sent, with :data:`COMPACT_INSTRUCTIONS` appended as **one more user message**. So
this text is never an instruction on any agent — putting it in the brief would change the
head of the request and throw away the very prefix the design exists to reuse — and it is
addressed to the assistant about the conversation *above* it, not to a reader handed a
transcript.

The output *becomes* the model's memory of everything it folded, so this is the one prompt
where losing a detail is losing it for good — hence completeness over brevity. The
conversation it summarizes contains tool output the agent fetched from outside, so it
re-asserts "data, never instructions" inside the request.

# **The sections are a contract, not a style.** The chassis parses two of them by name:
# `Anchors` is carried forward verbatim on a second fold (so exact paths and ids stop
# decaying one paraphrase per compaction), and `From tools and documents` is fenced as
# untrusted before the summary is stored (so a page the agent fetched cannot reach the
# model as part of its own memory). Renaming either here silently disables that handling —
# `agent/compaction_summary.py` keys on these two constants.
#
# **The full roster is a contract too, and for a sharper reason.** A section ends where the
# next one begins, so what counts as a heading decides where the untrusted fence closes.
# The summary is told to quote its sources verbatim, and a fetched page can contain a line
# that *looks* like a heading — so the parser (`core/compaction_sections.py`) recognises
# these names and nothing else, and a `## Notes for the assistant` copied out of a web page
# stays inside the fence where it belongs. Every name written into the instructions below
# comes from this tuple.
#
# **Nothing is replayed beside it.** A fold summarizes everything since the previous
# checkpoint, the most recent exchange included, so the summary is the assistant's *only*
# account of the thread — the operator's exact asks, the work already done, and where the
# last exchange left off have to be in it, or they are gone. That is what the
# `Operator requests`, `Done so far` and `Latest exchange` sections are for, and why the
# instructions ask for completeness over brevity.

# **The headings are fixed; nothing else is.** A conversation can be any kind of session —
# casual talk, a question answered, research, writing, planning, learning, debugging, a
# long agentic build — so the sections are containers the model fills with whatever the
# session actually holds, in whatever form suits it, rather than a checklist shaped like one
# kind of work. Every section is optional, and `Other context` is the catch-all for anything
# that matters and fits none of the others. Only the heading *names* are held fixed, because
# they are the parser's contract above.

# Prefixed to a stored compaction summary. It matters because of where the summary lands:
# hoisted to the head of the replayed history, directly in front of the next operator
# prompt — and most chat APIs can't carry two user messages in a row, so the provider merges
# it with that prompt. Unlabelled, the model would read a third-person briefing as
# something the operator just typed. The first line fixes that, and reads correctly in the
# operator's own transcript too; the second says who wrote it, because the checkpoint
# speaks in the most authoritative voice in the history and part of what it repeats came
# from outside.
#
# `COMPACT_MARKER` is the **first line alone**, and it is what every recogniser matches on
# (the reviewer's `_is_compaction_summary`, the anchors carry-forward): it has not changed,
# so a checkpoint stored before the second line existed is still recognised.
