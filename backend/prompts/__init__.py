"""The prompt library — every standing instruction we hand an LLM, in one place.

A prompt is product behavior, not an implementation detail: the words below are
what make the agent *act like Odysseus* turn after turn, so they live together
where they can be read, diffed, and tuned as a set rather than scattered as
inline string literals across the modules that happen to call a model.

Two domains:

- the **main agent** — :mod:`prompts.agent` (its ``SYSTEM_PROMPT``, identity and
  voice anchored in history; its ``INSTRUCTIONS``, autonomy, tool posture and
  safety guardrails re-asserted fresh every turn; the date line; the verifier's
  nudge), plus the two files holding what is true of *this thread* rather than of
  every thread: :mod:`prompts.modes` (what kind of work it is) and
  :mod:`prompts.levels` (how far the model may go before it asks). Those two are
  reached through the registries that own the rows — ``services.modes`` and
  ``services.permissions`` — so a mode's or a level's prose sits beside the rest
  of its declaration instead of in a branch at the engine.
- :mod:`prompts.utility` — the cheap background calls (the thread **namer**, the
  deliverable **judge**) that run on the utility model.

Prompts are plain Python string constants so callers compose them the same way
they compose any other value (``.format(...)`` for the templated ones). Import
the specific constant — ``from prompts.agent import INSTRUCTIONS`` — rather than
reaching through this package.
