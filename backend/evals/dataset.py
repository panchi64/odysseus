"""Synthetic corpora + labeled query/question sets for the eval suite.

Everything here is **fabricated** — none of it is read from ``data/``. There are
two corpora, one per embedding consumer:

- ``MEMORIES`` — ~30 operator memories spanning the categories the agent prompt
  names: preference, project, person, standing constraint, how-they-like-things.
- ``CONVERSATIONS`` — ~15 short prior conversations (a few labeled turns each) on
  distinct topics, seeded through the persistence path so the drainer embeds them.

Each consumer carries two diagnostic retrieval slices, both designed to isolate a
single signal:

- *paraphrase* — the query shares **no tokens** with its gold item, so only the
  dense (embedding) path can hit it. This is the slice that proves embeddings beat
  keyword.
- *rare_token* — an exact identifier/code that embeddings tend to miss, so the
  sparse (keyword) path must carry it.

And two end-to-end question sets per consumer:

- *should_trigger* — answerable only from a stored memory / past conversation;
  each carries a ``gold_fact`` substring for a deterministic grounding check.
- *should_not_trigger* — generic world knowledge; the retrieval tool firing here
  is a false positive / wasted call.

A note on the slice invariant: the paraphrase queries are checked at import time
(:func:`_assert_no_token_overlap`) to genuinely share no alphanumeric token with
their gold item, so the "only dense can hit" property is real, not assumed.
