"""What the conversation store keeps in memory, and what it gives back.

Every warm entry is a fully *decrypted* tree — inline image bytes included — so an
unbounded one grows to the size of every conversation the process has ever touched. The
bound is what makes that a working set instead of a leak, and it is only real if the
things that make an entry unevictable (a queued write, a rehydrate in flight) are the
exceptions and not the rule. These pin the residency policy itself, since nothing about
it is visible from a passing read.
