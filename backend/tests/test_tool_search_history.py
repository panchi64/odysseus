"""A revealed tool group, everywhere history is touched.

Dormant categories are loaded *by the model, mid-turn*, and the library remembers that in
one place only: the messages. Pydantic AI re-derives the revealed set from the outgoing
history on every single request, so a group stays loaded exactly as long as the exchange
that loaded it is still being replayed — and silently unloads the moment it isn't. Every
seam that rewrites, folds, branches or projects a history is therefore also a seam that
can take the browser back off a thread mid-task.

So these drive real turns through the real orchestrator over a ``FunctionModel``, and read
the **tool list each request was actually handed** rather than asserting about a toolset in
isolation: whether a group is loaded is a fact about the request that ships, not about the
stack that built it.

The one seam that needed fixing is compaction. Both folds replace the folded stretch with a
summary checkpoint, and the reveal goes with it — so the fold carries every tool the folded
stretch had revealed onto the checkpoint as a ``ToolAvailabilityDeltaPart``, the library's
own shape for "the tools changed here". Everything else here holds already, and is pinned
because nothing in the code says so.
