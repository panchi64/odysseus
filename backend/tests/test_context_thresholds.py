"""Where the context gauge changes colour, and who decides.

The boundaries used to be two literals inside the derivation. They are now the
operator's, because the fullness at which a window's remaining room stops being enough
depends on how someone works rather than on the model — a thread of long tool results
can spend its last quarter in one turn. What that change has to preserve is that there
is still exactly *one* boundary in play: the level travels on the wire, and a live turn,
a reloaded thread and an unattended task must all resolve it against the same pair.
