"""What a tool's description says, measured on the catalog a real run is handed.

Two of the three authors of that text are outside this repo — Pydantic AI, which wraps
any docstring with a ``Returns:`` section in XML, and ``pydantic_ai_harness``, whose
toolsets cross-reference each other by the un-namespaced names their own functions carry.
``tools/describe.py`` is the pass that fixes both, and the assertions worth having are
the ones taken over the **assembled** catalog rather than over hand-written samples: a
harness upgrade that reintroduces a leak, or a new category whose docstrings point at
names nothing is registered under, is exactly the regression this file exists to catch.
