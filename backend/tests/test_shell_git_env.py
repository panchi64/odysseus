"""A repository's own config is content, and it must not be able to run a program.

`git status` and `git diff` read as observations — the deterministic stage cleared them as
such — but git consults `.git/config` on the way, and several of its keys name a program
git then executes: `core.fsmonitor` on a status, a pager on anything that prints. In a
worktree that file is the *main checkout's*, so it is not even the agent's own branch that
decides.

The reproduction below is the one from the review, run against a real repository with a
real hook. What it pins is not "git is safe" but that the environment we spawn commands in
takes those keys back off the repository — **and that it takes nothing else off them**:
the second test runs an ordinary `git diff` in an ordinary repository, because a pin that
disarms a key by breaking the command is not a fix, and the previous spelling of these
pins (`diff.external=`, an empty *program* rather than an absence) did exactly that in
every repository on the machine.
