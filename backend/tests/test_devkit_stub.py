"""The stub, driven the way the app drives it.

Every test here goes through the real ``openai`` client, and the last two through the
real Pydantic AI model the registry builds — over an ASGI transport, so there is no port
and no process, but every byte of encoding and decoding is the production path. A stub
asserted against by reading its own output would only prove it is self-consistent; what
matters is that the client the app actually uses understands it.
