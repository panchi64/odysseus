"""Backend guards against a live run racing a second submission or a branch-tree
mutation on the same conversation (chat-03, chat-04, resume-02 backend half).

A live (queued/running/awaiting_input) run on a conversation must block every
leaf-moving branch op and a second ``/chat/regenerate``/``/chat/edit`` submission
with a clear 409 raised **before** any store mutation. A second plain-text
``/chat`` POST is the exception: it queues into the live run (mid-run steering)
instead of being rejected — only an attachment-carrying send still 409s.
