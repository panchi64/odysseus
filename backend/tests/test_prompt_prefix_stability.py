"""The head of a request must be the same bytes on turn two as on turn one.

Everything the prompt-cache work rests on is this one property. llama.cpp matches a
longest common prefix per slot, vLLM chains block hashes, and the OpenAI wire has a single
implicit breakpoint over the whole rendered prefix — so each of them reuses a request's
leading tokens only while they are identical to what it saw last, and a single byte moving
anywhere in the head re-reads the entire conversation behind it. On a long local thread that
is the difference between a turn starting immediately and a turn starting in fourteen
seconds.

`agent/prefix_watch.py` *reports* when that happens at runtime. These tests are what stop it
happening in the first place, by pinning the properties a future contributor could break
without any test noticing: a timestamp or a counter added to a head block, a set iterated
into the tool array, a static instruction registered after a dynamic one.

The agent is built twice throughout, because `build_agent` runs once per turn — a property
asserted over one agent's two requests would prove nothing about the next turn, which is
exactly where the expensive invalidations live.
