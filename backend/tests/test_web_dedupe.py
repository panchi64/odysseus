"""The web tools refuse a repeat before it costs anything.

A thread that reads widely loops: it re-asks a query it already asked, or re-fetches a
page whose text is already in its own context, and pays a network round trip plus a second
copy of the result for nothing. The run-wide seen-set (`services/search/dedupe.py`, carried
on `RunDeps`) is the discipline salvaged from the deep-research pipeline, now applied where
any thread can benefit from it.

Five properties are the ones that break silently:

- the check runs **before** the call, so a repeat costs no network at all;
- the key is *claimed* by that check rather than committed after it, so two calls the model
  made in one parallel batch cannot both slip past it and both hit the network;
- a claim is handed back when the call failed — a search that errored or a page that
  refused to render was never read, and keeping its key would tell the model it has
  evidence it does not have;
- the key covers everything that changes what comes back, so the same words asked over a
  different window are a new search rather than a refused repeat;
- ``offset > 0`` is the documented way to continue a truncated page, so a paging fetch is
  never mistaken for a repeat.
