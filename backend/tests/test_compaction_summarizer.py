"""The compaction summarizer: who writes it, what it is sent, and how far it is trusted.

The summary a fold produces is stored as a user-shaped checkpoint and replayed by the main
model as its own memory of everything it replaces. It is written by the turn's own agent,
continuing its own conversation, which makes three properties load-bearing:

- **The request is the turn's.** The thread's replay, normalised as a turn normalises it,
  plus one appended user message — on the same brief and the same tool array — so a local
  engine serves it from the prefix it already holds. The compaction prompt is never part of
  the brief, and the call runs with ``tool_choice='none'``.
- **It is a side run.** A tool call in the reply fails the fold and is never executed; the
  observers that keep state on the agent (the injection announcer, the prefix watch) leave
  it alone; only the answer text is kept, never the model's reasoning.
- **Trust and fidelity.** The one section that repeats tool-sourced facts is fenced on the
  way into the checkpoint, and the exact paths, ids and numbers in the Anchors section are
  carried across a second fold verbatim instead of being paraphrased once per compaction.
