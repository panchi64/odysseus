"""The embedding capability's client lifetime.

`RegistryEmbedder.embed` sits on the hottest path in the system — once per stored
conversation turn, once per memory write, once per recall — and it builds a transient
`AsyncOpenAI` per call. A client that isn't closed strands an httpx connection pool and
its sockets, so "was it closed on *this* path" is the property worth pinning, on the
failure paths above all: those are the ones that repeat while nothing works.

The role→spec resolution itself is covered in `test_registry.py`; here the registry is a
stub so the test is about the client and nothing else.
