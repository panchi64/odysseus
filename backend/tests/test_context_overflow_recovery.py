"""Surviving the context ceiling — the projected trigger, and the in-turn recovery.

Two related behaviours, one subject: a turn that would not fit.

The **trigger** now measures what this turn is about to cost, not what the last one did.
A thread at 70% with a 15% prompt in hand is a thread that must fold *now*; measuring the
history alone could only ever notice after the fact, which is why the threshold had to sit
at 95% to be safe.

The **recovery** is what happens when the provider refuses anyway — because the estimate
was low, because the operator pasted something enormous, because a tool returned far more
than anyone expected. The old behaviour stopped the turn *and left the oversized request in
history*, so it replayed on every later turn and the thread was finished. Now the turn
folds once and re-sends the very request that overran, against the summary.

The engine's own invariants are what these tests are really about: the persistence index
moves with the fold (or the turn re-records history it never wrote), the retry happens
once, and a correction — whose drop range is indexed into the pre-fold history — is barred
from folding at all.
