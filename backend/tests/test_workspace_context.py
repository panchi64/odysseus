"""The per-turn workspace block: what the model is told it already has on disk.

The bug it closes is not a bug in any one function. `code_execute` returns two streams
and `files_write_file` returns a byte count, so the only record that a file exists was
the tool call still sitting in the replayed history — and a compaction replaces that
stretch with a summary. Past the fold the agent's own files went invisible to it and it
rebuilt them. So the two things worth pinning here are that the block is derived from
disk rather than from anything remembered, and that asking for it costs nothing when
there is nothing to say.
