"""The sandbox filesystem tools: bound to the run's own workspace, contained to it,
and degrading rather than failing when no sandbox runtime exists.

The tools themselves are `pydantic_ai_harness`'s, so their internals aren't retested
here. What *is* ours is the binding — which directory a given run's call acts on — and
that is exactly what a shared, app-lifetime toolset object could get wrong.
