"""Projecting a settled history into turns — the tool/operator boundary.

The case that pins this down is a tool that hands back pixels. ``browse_screenshot``
returns ``ToolReturn(text, content=[BinaryContent(png)])``, and Pydantic AI moves that
content into a ``UserPromptPart`` appended to the *same* ``ModelRequest`` as the tool
return, because no provider accepts an image inside a tool result. Read naively that is
indistinguishable from the operator speaking — and reading it that way costs three
things at once, all asserted below.
