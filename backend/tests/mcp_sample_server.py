"""A real, tiny MCP server over stdio — the fixture the discovery tests dial.

Run as a subprocess by :mod:`tests.test_mcp_discovery` so the registry is exercised
against an actual MCP handshake rather than a mock of one: the point of the slice is that
we speak the protocol through Pydantic AI's client, and only a real server proves it.

Deliberately two tools, so a test can show that trust granted to one leaves the other
approval-gated (`AE-3.6` is per tool, never per server).
