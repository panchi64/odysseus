"""``TurnFlush`` — the shared "persist a turn that was stopped from outside" machinery.

The three paths it drives (a bound, a cancel, an unhandled exception) are covered
end-to-end in ``test_persistence.py`` against real orchestrators. What's here is the two
properties the class itself now owns, which both orchestrators depend on and neither can
express alone.
