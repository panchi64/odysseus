"""Forking a thread from one of its messages.

The thing that separates a fork from the branch operations already in the store
(regenerate/edit/rewind) is that it produces a **second conversation**. So what these
assert, mostly, is that the source is left alone: same leaf, same message ids, same
history. A fork that quietly repositioned the original would look identical in the new
thread and be a data-loss bug in the old one.
