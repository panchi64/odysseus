"""Dormant categories — the groups the model loads for itself, mid-turn.

The saving only counts if all three halves hold at once: the schemas really are off the
first request, naming a group really brings **all** of it back, and nothing the chassis
withheld for its own reasons — an operator's switch, a permission level — comes back with
it. So these tests drive a real ``Agent`` over a ``FunctionModel`` and read the tool list
the model was actually handed on each step, rather than asserting about the toolset stack
in isolation: deferral is resolved by the *model request*, and a stack that marks a tool
correctly can still ship it.
