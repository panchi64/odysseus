"""The deterministic stage: what it reads off a command, and what it refuses to vouch for.

Two halves, tested apart because they fail apart. The **extraction** says what a command's
syntax names; the **judge** checks that against the reach the call declared and the fence
this host can build. A bug in the first is a command described as less than it is — a
failure the second cannot catch — so most of what is pinned here is the extraction refusing
to describe, rather than the judge refusing to approve.

Every "not approved" below is an *escalation*, never a refusal: the call goes to the model
reviewer. That is what makes the structural stage affordable to keep strict, and it is why
the tests are written as "this does not pass the cheap stage" rather than "this is
forbidden".

The helpers default to a host that *can* fence, because that is the interesting
configuration — the fact is an argument precisely so a test does not depend on the machine
it runs on, and the case where it is missing is pinned explicitly.
