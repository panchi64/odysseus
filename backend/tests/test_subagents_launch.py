"""A sub-agent, launched as an ordinary turn.

Delegation used to run a bespoke `Agent(...)` loop of its own, inside the calling tool,
blocking the parent's turn for as long as it took. It is now a conversation composed by
the same `compose_turn` every other turn goes through. What that buys — and therefore what
these hold onto — is that the sub-agent is an *ordinary* run: the same engine, the same
persisted transcript, the same context gauge, the same approval machinery.

The things worth pinning are the ones that would quietly stop being true:

- `launch` **returns before the sub-agent finishes**, which is the whole point of the
  change and the one property the blocking version could not have;
- the sub-agent can never do **more than the thread that launched it**;
- it **cannot launch sub-agents of its own**, so the depth is one by construction rather
  than by a counter somebody has to maintain;
- its thread is **hidden but real** — no one can type into it, and its transcript is a
  conversation the panel can open by id;
- it is **registered durably**, because a link held only in memory leaves the operator
  with unreachable transcripts after a restart;
- isolation only ever **increases**: the launch may ask a sharing sub-agent to step out of
  the way, and may never pull an isolated one into the operator's own files.
