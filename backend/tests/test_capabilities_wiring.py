"""Regression guard: every capability the agent resolves from the run's bag must be
assembled into the app's one agent-facing bag.

``ServiceContainer.get_optional`` returning ``None`` is the tools' *degrade* contract —
a tool whose capability isn't wired reports itself unavailable instead of crashing the
turn. The flip side is that a manifest which forgets its ``capabilities`` export (or an
app-assembly line that drops a core handle) still type-checks, still imports, and still
passes every unit test; the tool just goes silently unavailable at runtime. The old
hand-enumerated ``Capabilities`` dataclass had exactly this failure mode at every
construction site — the approval-resume path once shipped without the handles for the
very tools only it can execute. The bag has one assembly point, so one test can now
guard all of it: collect every type the tool and agent layers look up, boot the real app,
and demand each one is present.
