"""Browser control: the conversation-scoped session and the tools bound to it.

Two layers, fastest-first:
- ``BrowserSessionManager`` — attach/reap/evict, the degrade path, and what counts as
  somebody using a browser (fake host, fake sessions).
- the toolset — that two conversations drive two *pages*, not merely two toolsets.

Nothing here starts Chromium: what is worth guarding is the wiring around the harness's
browser, and launching a real window would make these tests slow, flaky and
environment-dependent without testing more of our own code. ``test_browser_host.py``
covers the launch itself, equally without one.
