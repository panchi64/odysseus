"""The per-conversation work summary: what the summariser reads, and what the sweep picks.

Two halves, and they fail in different ways.

The **transcript** is the half with a security property. Unlike the titler next door, this
summariser has to read model-authored text — what the agent did is only in its own answers
and tool calls — so the operator's turns stand in the clear and everything else is fenced.
A regression there does not break the feature; it quietly hands a small, unguarded model a
web page's instructions wearing the workspace's voice, and stores the result as the
thread's own account of itself. Tool *returns* are excluded outright, which is the one
place this differs from the compaction transcript, and that exclusion is load-bearing for
the same reason.

The **sweep** is the half with an economic property: every candidate it picks is a model
call, so each of the three conditions it applies is tested from both sides. A thread still
in use, a thread already summarized since it last spoke, and a thread with a run streaming
into it are all threads where the call would be wasted or wrong.
