"""The byte budget on a project's own instruction files.

What is pinned is the *order of sacrifice*: broad files go whole before the specific one
is cut at all, and a cut lands on a line boundary with a marker the model can read. A
budget that truncated whichever file it reached first would be arithmetically correct and
practically useless — it would take the sentences the agent is standing in front of and
keep the ones about the monorepo.
