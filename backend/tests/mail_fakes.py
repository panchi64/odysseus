"""A fake ``MailTransport`` — the seam's own conformance target.

Every mail test above the adapters runs against this instead of a live mailbox, which is
the point of the transport being a Protocol: the sync loop, the cache, triage and the
agent's tools are exercised end to end with no network, and anything they rely on is by
construction part of the published seam rather than an IMAP detail that leaked upward.
