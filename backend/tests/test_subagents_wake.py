"""A finished sub-agent's report reaching the thread that launched it.

The launching turn does not wait: it starts sub-agents, carries on, and ends. So something
has to carry each report back afterwards and get the model working again, and these hold
the properties that make that safe rather than merely working.

The load-bearing one is first: **a sub-agent finishing mid-stream must not interrupt the
parent.** A report rides the same road an operator's mid-turn message does, and that road
hands a queued message to the *next, not-yet-sent* request — so the model's tokens finish
and the report lands at the following boundary. There is deliberately no second delivery
route; a second route is how that guarantee would be lost.

The one that road does not cover is next: a report arriving during the parent's **final**
stream, where no further request is ever made. The substrate drops what is still queued at
terminal — correct for the operator, whose client rebuilds their own text from the replay,
and silently lossy for a report, which nothing else holds.
