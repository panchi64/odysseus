"""The seventh axis — a category whose backing service the operator never set up.

``mail``, ``calendar`` and ``vault`` are the three groups that can be fully registered,
fully enabled, and still have nothing behind them: no mailbox connected, no calendar
added, no secrets vault created. Before this axis existed the model was handed all
fourteen of those tools on a fresh install and learned what the catalog already knew, one
failed call at a time.

Most of it runs against a **booted app**, because the fact under test is a wiring one: a
manifest declares the check, the assembly resolves it to namespaced tool names, and the
one funnel every run path composes its disabled set through has to ask it. Testing the
function alone would pass while any of those three came apart.
