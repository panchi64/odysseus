"""The `@` picker's listing: which filesystem answers, and what it will not do.

The subtle one is the root. A worktree that exists on disk but has no entry in the
manager's in-memory holder map — every worktree, after a backend restart — must still be
recognised as the thread's, or the picker quietly lists the operator's own checkout while
the agent reads the branch. The operator would pick a path from one tree and the agent
would resolve it in another, and nothing would say so.
