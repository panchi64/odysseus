"""Chat file attachments + the retroactive knowledge-base exclude toggle.

Covers the two halves of the feature: an attached file is **staged into the conversation's
sandbox** and announced to the model as a short marker naming its path (so the model reads
and pages through the file itself instead of receiving its text — an image being the one
exception, still handed over as pixels), with `attachments_provision` as the re-stage path
for a recycled session; and an enrolled upload can be scoped out of the corpus
retroactively, dropping it from every retrieve.
