"""What the context window is holding, split three ways.

The provider reports one number and no breakdown, so the split is measured on our side —
the same posture as the wall-clock timings, and for the same reason: it has to mean the
same thing on Anthropic, on an OpenAI-compatible endpoint and on a local server.

The two properties that matter are asserted throughout. The parts always sum to exactly
the total the provider reported, because a breakdown that disagrees with the figure above
it reads as a bug even when the drift is one token. And a split that couldn't be measured
is absent rather than zeroed — a composition claiming no system prompt and no tools would
be a confident lie about the one thing this readout exists to expose.
