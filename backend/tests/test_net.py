"""``core.net.await_http_ready`` — the shared "it is actually serving" probe.

A *bound* port is not a serving one: a dev server or an inference engine accepts
connections well before it answers a request. Both the sandbox preview and the engine
supervisor wait on this, and they disagree only about what a timeout means, so the
contract they share is what these cover.
