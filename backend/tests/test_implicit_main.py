"""What `main` resolves to when the operator has bound nothing.

An unbound `main` used to be a degraded capability, which made a fresh workspace refuse
every turn. That was defensible when the picker also showed nothing — but the picker
resolves a *display* fallback ("first available model") of its own, so the composer
showed a model, SEND refused it, and re-picking that exact model in the dropdown was the
only way to make the two agree. The display was a fiction; nothing had been bound.

So `main` now resolves to the first usable endpoint and model when nothing is bound, and
says so: the roles listing reports what it resolved to with `implicit` set, and the
picker shows *that* rather than guessing. Display and execution come from one answer.

It is a default and never a pin — recomputed, never written — which is what these tests
pin down: adding a better endpoint has to move it, and an explicit choice has to win and
stop being implicit.
