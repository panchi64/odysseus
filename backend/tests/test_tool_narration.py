"""The per-call ``narration``: offered in the schema, gone again before validation.

The argument exists in two places that have to agree — ``tools/describe.py`` puts a
property on every acting tool's schema, ``tools/narration.py`` takes it back off the raw
arguments before Pydantic AI validates them — and the failure mode if they disagree is not
subtle: the library validates a call against the tool function's own signature with extras
forbidden, so a narration that survives to validation is a ``ValidationError``, which the
library turns into a retry prompt telling the model its call was malformed for using the
property it was offered. The model then writes the same call again.

So the assertions here are end to end, through a real turn: a narrated call runs, the tool
function sees only its own parameters, and the operator's work log keeps the sentence. The
unit assertions underneath cover the two shapes providers send arguments in, and the
second pass an approval resume performs over arguments this capability has already seen.
