"""`AE-3.6` — external tools are sensitive by default, trusted one at a time.

Driven end to end against a real MCP server: the agent is composed exactly as a chat turn
composes it, and what is asserted is the behaviour the requirement names — an untrusted
tool *parks* for approval, a trusted one *runs*, trust granted to one tool leaves its
sibling on the same server parked, and revoking it puts the tool straight back to parking.
