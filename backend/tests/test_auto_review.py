"""Auto's review: the two stages, the arithmetic over their answers, and the degrade.

Auto is the one level where nobody is asked. Everything here is therefore a test of one
proposition — that a call runs without the operator **only** when something explicitly
cleared it — so the interesting cases are the ways the review can fail rather than the
ways it can pass. A missing model, a slow one, an unparseable answer and a poisoned
transcript all have to end in the same place: the operator's prompt.
