"""Compaction defaults and the operator's dials over them.

Three things are worth pinning here, because each of them silently changes when a fold
happens:

- **The config defaults.** 80% (not 95%, which folds with no room left for the turn that
  triggered the fold), a summarizer input ceiling of 32k, and a summarizer timeout *below*
  the inactivity watchdog — a summarizer allowed to run as long as the watchdog would let
  the watchdog kill the run it was trying to save.
- **The stored preferences**, and their resolution into the policy the engine reads.
- **The round-trip through ``PUT /chat/settings``**, including the rule that a body
  touching one field of the group leaves the others alone.
