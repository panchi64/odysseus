"""Compaction at a **branch point** — folding while a regenerate or an edit has the
active leaf reseated.

This used to be refused outright, which made the one moment compaction is most needed —
re-answering the very request that just filled the window — the one moment it could not
happen. It is allowed now, and what makes it safe is a single rule:

    **A compaction checkpoint is transparent in version sets.**

The checkpoint lands under the reseated leaf and the incoming answer hangs off the
checkpoint, so every enumeration that asks "what are this turn's other versions" has to
look *through* the checkpoint rather than stopping at it. These tests pin that rule at
each site it has to hold: version chips, version switching, a second regenerate, rewind,
delete, the turn count `compaction_plan` cuts on, and a cold reload — because a shape
that only holds in memory is a shape that breaks on the operator's next page load.
