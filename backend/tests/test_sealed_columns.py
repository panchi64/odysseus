"""`XC-SEC-3` — the two columns that used to be stored in the clear.

`Conversation.title` is an auto-generated LLM summary of the operator's first message,
the most revealing single line a thread has, and `CorpusSource.path` names the operator's
own filesystem. Both are now sealed. Because the migration that added the sealed columns
runs before unlock (no key), the interesting cases are the transitional ones: a row that
still holds legacy cleartext must read correctly *before* the backfill touches it, and
must have no plaintext left *after*.
