"""The OS fence a cleared worktree command runs inside.

Three layers, and they fail for three different reasons. The **profile** is a pure
translation of a checkout into two lists of paths — it is wrong when a path a commit needs
is missing, or when one a repository must not choose for us is present. **`GitDirs`** reads
a real linked worktree, which is the one shape that cannot be reasoned about from a string:
`.git` is a *file* there, and the objects and refs live somewhere else entirely. And the
**wrapper** is the shim that keeps `cd` working across calls, which is our code sitting
between two pieces of somebody else's.

The last test actually runs commands under the fence. It is the only one that can fail for
a reason nothing here wrote — a missing `sandbox-exec`, a missing `bwrap`, a missing
`ripgrep` — so it skips rather than failing, and everything above it is host-independent.

**What the fence does and does not bound, stated once.** Writes are deny-by-default with an
allowlist and egress is allowlist-only; *reads* are allow-by-default with a denylist, and
``sandbox_runtime`` has no read allowlist to change that. So a fenced command can still read
the operator's files outside the worktree, and nothing here can be written to prove
otherwise — which is why the plan's `cat ../x` case is pinned in
``tests/test_shell_judge.py`` against the *judge* instead, and why the judge's containment
carries the whole weight for reads. What the fence is the backstop for is what a command
*writes* or *sends* beyond what it named — a program the repository configured, a build
script, a postinstall hook — which is exactly the class no reading of the command line
could have caught.
