"""One workspace-key convention, honoured by both workspace kinds.

A workspace key has always been able to name a *delegation* of a workspace rather than the
workspace itself — a forked sandbox is keyed ``<parent>/<child>`` — but only the sandbox
half read it that way. The worktree half keyed off the conversation instead, which is why a
delegated run in code mode could be handed its own container and never its own checkout:
its conversation does not hold the project, so it was refused as a rival for it.

These hold the two halves of that: that the split is read the same way everywhere, and that
an ordinary run — whose key *is* its conversation — resolves exactly as it did before.
