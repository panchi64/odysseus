"""A turn carrying `@` file references: what reaches the model, and what does not.

The claim being defended is that a reference is a **reference**. The turn names paths; it
does not read them. That is what keeps an `@` from twenty turns ago pointing at a file
whose old contents are still being replayed, and it is why the marker is trusted content —
there is no file text in it to be untrusted about.
