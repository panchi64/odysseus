"""Plan mode: the level moving from inside the run, and the three answers to a plan.

The two halves worth pinning are the ones that are easy to get subtly wrong and impossible
to see from the outside. **Entering binds within the turn** — the conversation row is the
durable half, but a model whose catalog only narrowed on the *next* turn could announce
plan mode and keep editing for the rest of this one. And **approving is one act**: the
operator's yes records the plan, seeds the task list and raises the level, and a path that
did any one of those without the others is a thread that can act with nothing agreed, or
has agreed to something it cannot act on.
