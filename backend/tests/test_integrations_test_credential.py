"""Proving a connector's credentials (`INTEG-3`) and calling one (`INTEG-2`).

The outbound path is driven through an ``httpx.MockTransport``, so these assert the
things that actually matter about it — where the credential goes, that the resolved URL
is SSRF-guarded and stays inside the operator's connector, that a redirect is refused, and
that a failed test is recorded rather than raised — without touching the network.
