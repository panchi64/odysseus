"""A turn sent with a slash command: what the model gets, and what is written down.

The whole design rests on those two being different. The operator's literal `/reviewer
check the auth path` is their turn and persists; the expansion rides the tail of the same
user prompt and is stripped before the turn is recorded. If either half of that stops
being true the feature is either useless (the model never learns what the command meant)
or corrosive (an old expansion replays forever, and a reviewer reads repo-authored text
under the operator's own label).
