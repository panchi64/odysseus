"""Lanes — the operator's turn never queues behind unattended work.

The bug this replaces was invisible rather than loud: one pool of eight slots, a
scheduled task and a few agent-opened research threads filling it, and the operator's
next message sitting at the gate looking exactly like a slow model. So what is pinned
here is the *separation*, not the numbers — that a saturated autonomous lane leaves the
interactive one untouched, and that every kind the composition path actually submits
under lands where it says it does.
