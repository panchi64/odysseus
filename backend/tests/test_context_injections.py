"""What the chassis put in front of the model, said out loud.

Every turn carries text nobody in the conversation wrote — a project's instruction files,
the skill catalog, the plan reminder, the date. The gauge has always been able to say what
those cost; these tests pin the other half, which is what they *said* and when they
arrived, because that is the half that accounts for a model behaving as though it had been
told something the transcript never mentions.

Three properties carry the feature and each has its own section below: an injection is
announced once per turn per distinct text (a five-step turn must not echo its own preamble
five times), the token figure is over the whole block even when the wire caps the text, and
the contributor slug is the same one the context gauge files that block under — so the two
surfaces can never name one block two ways.
