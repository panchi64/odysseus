"""The native file/folder chooser — helper resolution, argv shape, and the contract the
routes above it depend on.

No real dialog is ever opened: `_run` is stubbed, or the helper is replaced with a small
script that prints a path. What matters here is that the module **degrades cleanly** (a
headless host reports unavailable rather than erroring), that a cancelled dialog is a
`None`, not a failure, and that a dialog nobody answers can't wedge the server.
