"""Worktrees, against real git.

Mocking git here would test nothing worth testing — the whole point of this layer is
that a real `git worktree add` behaves, that a branch can be checked out twice in a way
git accepts, and that the operator's own tree is genuinely untouched. So these drive the
real binary in a temporary repository.

The load-bearing assertion is the last one: after the agent has edited and committed in
its worktree, the operator's checkout still reads exactly what it did before.
