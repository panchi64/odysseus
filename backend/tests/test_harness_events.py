"""Attributing the events a lifted harness toolset emits.

Several `pydantic_ai_harness` capabilities emit `CapabilityEvent`s from inside their tool
functions, and this codebase registers those toolsets *directly* rather than registering the
capabilities that own them — so the tools stay inside the namespaced, operator-toggleable
catalog (`tools/CLAUDE.md`). Pydantic AI refuses a capability event it cannot attribute to a
registered capability, which makes that choice load-bearing in a way nothing announces: get
it wrong and the failure is not a boot error but a `UserError` mid-turn, on the first
mutation, in whichever category was lifted.

These are the three properties that keep it working.
