"""The code-mode shell, and the fence it will not run without.

Two things are pinned here and they fail in opposite directions. The **shape** is the
harness `Shell`'s — a `cd` that persists, a denylisted command that comes back as a retry,
a background process that can be checked and stopped — because the model was trained on it
and a first-party reimplementation is exactly the kind of thing that drifts quietly. The
**fence** is ours: every command goes through a confiner, with this conversation's egress
set and its worktree as the writable root, and when there is no confiner to go through the
tools refuse in words instead of running anyway.

The confiner is faked at the seam rather than exercised for real. Driving seatbelt from a
test would pin the platform's behaviour, not this code's, and only on the machines that
have it; what is worth asserting is that the arguments handed to the fence are the right
ones, which a recording stub says far more precisely.
