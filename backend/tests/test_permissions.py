"""The permission level: the knobs behind the four names, and the two halves that
enforce them.

Two halves, because one alone is not enforcement. The **toolset** marks every tool that
reaches past the level's write scope as needing approval, so the model's request for one
comes back undone instead of running — that half is checked through the composed stack a
real run resolves, not through a re-derivation of the rule. The **decision** then rules on
the call that came back. Between them sits the invariant worth the most here: a level only
ever adds a gate, never removes one. A tool that pauses its own calls is still answered at
every level — by the operator, or by the review at the one level whose entire meaning is
that they asked for their answers to be given for them — so raising a thread to Edit
cannot quietly delete a protection nobody re-examined.
