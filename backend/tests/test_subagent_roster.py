"""The roster — what the model may launch, and how a project adds to it.

The roster is the model's whole view of sub-agents: the launch tool's description is
generated from it, and a name the description does not carry is one nothing will ever ask
for. So these hold two kinds of property.

**The built-ins are real.** A spec names tools in `withheld` and `required`, and those
names are strings against a catalog that moves. A `required` name that no longer exists
makes the sub-agent permanently unlaunchable; a `withheld` one silently stops withholding.
Neither fails anywhere else, so they are pinned here against the catalog a real run
resolves — the same guard `tests/test_tool_sensitivity.py` keeps over its own literal.

**A project's own definitions are the same record.** A file under `.claude/agents/` becomes
a `SubagentSpec` and nothing downstream can tell it from a built-in — which is the claim
that makes the feature worth having, and the one that would quietly stop being true.

The last group is the one worth reading twice: a declaration is a **request**. A project
file can narrow what its sub-agent may do and can never widen it, because the file arrives
with a checkout and nobody approved it.
