"""Regression guard for the host surface: it is **agent-unreachable by construction**,
the same invariant the Operator Shell carries. Nothing under `tools/` or `agent/` may
reference `services/host_picker.py` or `services/host_open.py` — a model that could open
dialogs on the operator's desktop (and read back whatever path came out), or launch an
application on a path it chose, would be acting on the host outside every
sensitive-action approval gate.

Both halves are guarded together because they are one posture, and because the second is
the easier mistake to make: opening a file *looks* like a helpful thing to hand a model.

The needles are matched as substrings and ``host_open`` is a prefix, so the opener's
type-policy module (``services/host_open_policy.py``) is covered by the same entry — an
import of it names ``host_open`` too. Anything split out of these files must keep that
prefix, or earn its own needle here.
