"""Talking to a sub-agent that is still working.

Handing work over is not the same as forgetting about it. Half way through a sub-agent's
run the thread that launched it can learn something that changes what it wanted — the
operator narrowed the question, a sibling already covered half of it, a constraint arrived
— and without a way to say so the only options are to let it finish the wrong work or to
cancel and start again, both of which are paid for in full.

So a direction travels back down the link a report comes up. What is pinned here:

- it rides the **steering road**, which already guarantees a queued message is handed to
  the *next, not-yet-sent* request — so a direction can no more interrupt a sub-agent
  mid-stream than an operator's own mid-turn message can;
- it is **framed as a direction**, never bare and never as a report. A sub-agent's thread
  has no operator in it, so unframed text there is from nobody at all;
- the transcript reads that framing **back off**, so the operator sees the direction and
  not our markup;
- a sub-agent that has already settled is a **refusal with the truth in it** — its report
  is on its way — rather than a direction dropped in silence;
- and a sub-agent is offered **neither** this nor the listing, because both address another
  sub-agent by id and nothing about one's job needs to reach a sibling.
