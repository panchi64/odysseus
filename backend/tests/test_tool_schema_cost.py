"""What the tool catalog costs before the model has read a single message.

Every tool the model is offered arrives as name + description + JSON schema, at the head
of every request, whether or not the turn goes anywhere near it. That is the one part of
the window nobody chose and nobody sees, so it is measured here — against the *real*
assembled catalog (core plus every manifest's export), through the same
``agent.overhead`` sizing the context gauge draws from, so the unit here and the unit the
operator reads stay one unit.

Since the dormant categories landed there are two numbers, not one. A **fresh request**
carries ~35.6k characters across 34 tools — call it ~8.7k tokens — because five categories
(``browse``, ``calendar``, ``mail``, ``research``, ``vault``) ship with their schemas
withheld until the model asks for the group. The **corpus** behind it, every dormant group
revealed, is ~68k across 70; ``browse`` alone is 18 tools and most of the difference, which
is why it is dormant. A Plan-level turn is handed less of the corpus than an acting one, because
everything above ``read`` is withheld outright rather than offered and refused — but not
the ``plan`` and ``tasks`` categories, which a read-only turn needs precisely because it
is read-only.

Three things are pinned. A **ceiling on the fresh request**, which is what a turn actually
pays. A looser **ceiling on the corpus**, because a tool added to a dormant group is
invisible to the first ceiling and still costs the turn that opens the group. And the
**narrowing**, so the withholding that makes Plan cheap stays real: it is enforcement first
and a saving second, and a regression would be invisible from either side alone. A failure
here is not necessarily a bug, but it is always a decision somebody should make
deliberately.

#: What a fresh request's catalog may cost, in characters of serialized schema. Set a
#: little above today's ~35.6k so an ordinary addition lands quietly and a category-sized one
#: does not. Characters rather than tokens for the same reason the measurement itself uses
#: them: no tokenizer, no provider, no drift.
#:
#: **Raised once, from 26k, for the `plan` category** — the three tools that let a thread
#: enter plan mode, submit a plan and read the one it agreed to. They cost every request
#: about 1.5k characters, and they are the one addition that could not be paid for by
#: deferral: a model that has to reveal a dormant group before it can propose planning is a
#: model that has already started doing the work instead. The saving that would have come
#: from making them dormant is real and was declined on purpose.
#:
#: **Raised again, from 28k, for the per-call `narration` argument** — one string property,
#: with its instruction, on every tool that does more than read (``tools/describe.py``). It
#: took a fresh request from 25.9k to 30.1k characters and the corpus from 49.2k to 58.0k:
#: roughly 250 characters per acting tool, paid on every request whether or not the model
#: writes a sentence. Nothing here is deferrable — the property has to be on the schema of
#: whatever tool the model is about to call — and a shorter instruction was declined
#: because it gets narrations that describe the tool instead of the reason.
#:
#: **Raised a third time, from 33k, when the reads got it too.** The work log's collapsed
#: header now leads with the run's most recent reason, and a turn that spends ten calls
#: reading showed none for most of its length — a read's arguments say *what*, never *why*.
#: It took a fresh request to 35.6k characters and the corpus to 68.4k. The frontend could
#: have derived a phrase ("Reading agent.py") for free; that was declined because it restates
#: the arguments rather than giving the model's reason, which is the thing being paid for.
#:
#: **Raised a fourth time, from 38k, for `run_code`** (`agent/code_mode.py`): one more tool
#: whose description carries the Python signature of every tool the thread's level clears
#: unasked, since those stay direct calls *and* become callable from a script. It took a
#: fresh request from 36.6k to 46.0k characters at Auto. The library's own rendering — a
#: full docstring per function — would have cost 23.6k on its own; bare signatures, with the
#: prose left on the direct definition it repeats, is what brought it to 9.3k.
CATALOG_CEILING_CHARS = 48_000

#: The same for the whole corpus — every dormant group revealed. Deferral moves a group's
#: cost from every turn to the turns that want it; it does not make the group free, and a
#: ceiling that only watched the fresh request would let the dormant half grow unwatched.
#: Raised from 50k, then from 60k, then from 72k, alongside the ceiling above and for the
#: same reasons.
