"""The live stream and a reload must tell one turn in the same order.

A turn reaches the transcript twice: as events while it runs, and as a persisted message
once the conversation is read back. The two readers once disagreed — the reload flattened
the turn into one lane per kind — so a work log the operator watched interleave regrouped
itself the moment the run ended.

This test runs one interleaved turn through the real route and records both halves, side
by side, in a fixture the frontend owns: `streamParity.test.ts` folds the events and
decodes the message, and fails if the two produce different blocks. Neither side can
drift alone — a backend change that alters either half fails *here* until the fixture is
regenerated, and the regenerated fixture is then what the frontend is held to.

Regenerate with ``UPDATE_STREAM_PARITY=1 uv run pytest tests/test_stream_parity.py``.
