"""Conversation compaction — folding older turns into a utility-model summary.

The product's **one** context reduction, and the only one that fires on measured pressure —
the pressure-blind reductions (tool-result digesting, the attachment inline cap, the sandbox
output trim) are gone. What these guard, in order of how much damage getting them wrong
would do:

- **The persistence index.** ``agent/finalize.py`` records a turn as
  ``result.all_messages()[start:]``, with ``start = len(model_history)`` measured in
  ``agent/prelude.py`` after every history rewrite. The replay view
  reorders the tree, so if its length ever stopped matching what it represents, every turn
  after a compaction would persist the wrong slice.
- **Branch safety.** A checkpoint grafted onto a reseated leaf would re-parent the incoming
  answer out of its own version set, silently breaking version switching.
- **The boundary.** A fold takes everything since the newest checkpoint and nothing
  before it, so an earlier summary is absorbed rather than re-exposed as a turn.
- **Containment.** The summary is a real message row; it must not reach the listing
  preview, the message count, cross-chat search, or a transcript read.
