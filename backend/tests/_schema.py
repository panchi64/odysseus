"""One migrated schema, built once per session and copied into every test database.

`core.db.init_db` replays the whole Alembic chain, and most of those revisions are
SQLite batch rebuilds — the dialect can't alter a column in place, so it copies the
table to rewrite it. That is ~115 ms, and the suite builds a database per test, so the
default path spends over a minute per run replaying the same revisions to arrive at the
same schema.

The schema at head is deterministic, so it is built here **through the real chain** once
and then copied byte-for-byte into each fresh database with SQLite's own backup API. The
copy is not an approximation of the migrated schema: it *is* the migrated schema, pages
and `alembic_version` stamp included, which is why nothing has to be kept in step by hand
when a revision lands.

`real_init_db` stays exported for `test_migrations.py`, which is about the chain itself
and so has to run it.
