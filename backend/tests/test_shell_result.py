"""What a worktree command hands back, and what it says while it is still running.

The shell used to answer with one labelled string — `[stdout]`, `[stderr]`, `[exit code:
N]` — and everything downstream took it back apart to get at a field. These tests pin the
structure that replaced it, and they pin the two things the string could not express at
all: a timed-out command's output, and output that arrives before the command is over.

The runner is driven directly here, with no profile and no toolset. ``tools/shell.py``
owns the boundary a command runs under and ``tests/test_shell_fence.py`` owns testing it;
what is under test here is the shape of the answer, which is the same whether or not a
fence was built.
