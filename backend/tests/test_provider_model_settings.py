"""Standing per-provider model settings, and the Anthropic prompt cache they carry.

Two propositions, and the second is the reason the first exists.

The **placement**: settings a lab always wants are handed to the model where it is built
(``Model(settings=…)``), not to any one call site. Everything downstream — the fallback
chain, a turn parked for an approval and resumed later, every path that assembles its own
per-request settings — then carries them without knowing the lab exists, and a caller can
still override one because Pydantic AI merges a request's settings *over* the model's.

The **payload**: Anthropic's three cache breakpoints, which pay for the placement. A chat
turn re-sends its whole history behind an unchanging system block and a tool catalog of
some fourteen thousand tokens; without a breakpoint every turn buys them again.
