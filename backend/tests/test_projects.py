"""Projects: the catalog, the active selection, and the one scope rule.

The scope rule is the reason this feature is safe to introduce over an existing
database, so it is what these tests are mostly about:

    visible   = unfiled  ∪  the active project
    invisible = every other project

The load-bearing assertion is that a row created *before* projects existed
(``project_id is None``) stays visible once a project is activated. Get that wrong and
activating the first project blanks the operator's entire history — which is exactly the
kind of failure that looks like a working feature in every other test.
