"""The record of what is running, and who is allowed to forget it.

Every test here is about one property: an instance's services must stay reachable by
``stop``. That is easy to break precisely because ``up`` converges — most runs start
nothing, and a run that started nothing must not be allowed to say so in a way that
erases what an earlier run started. Both failures below were real.
