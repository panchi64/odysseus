"""`builtin_ask_user`: the turn stops on the operator for an *answer* rather than a
permission, and the answer they give becomes the call's own result.

The approval path and this one share a park, a payload and a resume, so most of what is
checked here is that sharing one machine for two reasons hasn't made either wrong: a turn
holding both piles parks once and refuses a half-answer, an answer is rendered from the
parked call rather than from whatever the client said it was, and a run nobody is watching
is never offered the tool at all.
