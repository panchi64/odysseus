"""Operator-authored workflows, and the commands a project declares in its own files.

The two sources the catalog did not have. They are different enough to be worth separating
in the reader's head and identical past the point of construction: one is a row the operator
saved, one is a markdown file that arrived with a checkout, and from ``CommandSpec`` onwards
nothing can tell them apart.

What is defended here is mostly what happens when something is *wrong* — a name that could
not be typed, a file with no template, a description written as a list — because both
sources are hand-authored and the failure modes are the whole difference between a picker
that degrades and one that disappears.
