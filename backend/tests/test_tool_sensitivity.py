"""Tool sensitivity classes, and the read-only catalog they make possible.

`services/tool_sensitivity.py` names every tool as a literal string, because `tools/` sits
above `services/` and importing the catalog there would invert the dependency order — the
same constraint `services/modes.py` works under, and the same tripwire: the literal is
checked against the catalog a real run resolves, in both directions. The direction that
actually rots is the second one. A tool added without a class would keep running under a
level that was supposed to withhold it, and nothing else in the system would notice.

The rest is the narrowing itself: that Plan is the only level that takes tools out of the
catalog, that it takes out everything that would change something *except* the plan writes
a Plan turn exists to make, and that a real run resolves the same answer through the
composed toolset stack rather than through a re-derivation of the rule.
