"""The discoverability contract.

A test rather than a convention, because the thing being protected is invisible from
inside the code: whether a session that has never seen this project can find the dev
instance and use it correctly. Nothing in the app breaks if these files stop being
written — the next session simply does not know the instance exists, discovers nothing,
and takes its visual claims on trust again.

The gitignore is what makes it fragile. ``.claude/`` and ``CLAUDE.md`` are both ignored on
purpose, so a hand-written copy dies with its worktree. These generate from the committed
recipe on every ``up``, and this is what keeps that true.
