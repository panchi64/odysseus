"""The fixture pack, run against a real app.

Not against a real *instance*: ``client_app`` boots the same application over an
in-memory database and an ASGI transport, which exercises every route the fixtures call
without a port, a process or a workspace on disk. What it cannot host is the stub — the
seeded endpoint points at an ``http://`` URL that nothing answers here — so the fixture
that drives real conversations is left to the end-to-end path and everything else is
covered here.

The contract worth guarding is the registration one: a fixture is a module plus a line,
the pack's version moves on its own, and a re-run does not double what it made. Those are
the properties a future session relies on without ever reading this package.
