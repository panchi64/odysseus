"""The prefix-cache diagnostic: does it see what an inference engine sees?

An instrument that reports the wrong cause is worse than no instrument, because the next
person spends their afternoon on the block it named. So these are mostly tests about
*honesty*: that a head change zeroes the reusable count rather than reporting the message
match anyway, that a wall-clock timestamp on a message part is not mistaken for a content
change, that the order of the tool array counts, and that an image is fingerprinted without
ever being rendered to a string.

The end-to-end half drives real turns through the agent the engine builds, because the whole
value of the reading is that the bytes hashed are the bytes that ship — after the system
prompt is reasserted and after the deferred schemas are gone. A unit test over hand-built
parts cannot assert that; only a turn can.
