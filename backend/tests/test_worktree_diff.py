"""The merge gate's contract: per-file rows, their risk verdict, and branch staleness.

Against real git, like `test_worktree.py` beside it — the rows are parsed from
``--numstat -z`` and ``--name-status -z``, and the whole value of that parsing is that it
survives what git actually emits: a rename as one record rather than two, a path with a
space in it, a deletion that is not just a file with zero lines left.

The classification assertions are the load-bearing ones. The frontend renders the verdict
and never computes it, so if a lockfile stops reading as a dependency change here, it
stops reading as one everywhere, and nothing downstream can notice.
