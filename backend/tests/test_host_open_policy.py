"""The type fence on `POST /host/open` — `services/host_open_policy`.

The attack these tests stand against, end to end: the agent writes a file into a project
root with an ordinary workspace-write (no approval gate on that), names it in its answer
behind anchor text of its choosing, and the operator's click hands it to the host's
"open with whatever handles this" program — which *runs* it. Containment is no defence,
because the file is genuinely inside the operator's own project.

So the refusals are the subject here, and they are written per class of executable thing
rather than per suffix: what must never regress is the deny-by-default posture, not the
particular spelling of any one entry in the allowlist.
