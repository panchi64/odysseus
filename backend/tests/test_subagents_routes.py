"""What the panel reads: a thread's sub-agents, live and finished.

One endpoint, and what these hold is mostly about what it deliberately *isn't*. There is no
sub-agent transcript route, no sub-agent cancel route and no sub-agent approval route,
because a sub-agent is a conversation and a run and those routes already exist — so the
properties worth pinning are the ones that make the card's other links work: every card
carries the ids that reach them, and the list is what survives a restart.
