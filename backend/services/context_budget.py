"""Splitting the context footprint into the things that fill it.

The provider tells us one number — how many tokens the last request cost — and nothing
about what they were spent on. Everything the operator can *act* on lives in the split:
a window that is 90% messages wants a compaction or a fresh thread, one that is 60% tool
schemas wants fewer tools switched on, and the two look identical from the total alone.

So the split is measured on our side, the same way the timings are, and for the same
reason: it has to mean the same thing on Anthropic, on an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, and
on a local server. No provider reports it, so nothing here can come from one.

**Two resolutions, one measurement.** The three group totals are what the gauge's bar is
drawn from; the segments itemise those same tokens — per tool category, per contributor
to the standing brief, per class of message content — because the three-way split ends
exactly where the operator's decision begins. Nothing is measured twice: every segment
belongs to one group, and the groups are sums of their segments.

**A segment exists only if it weighs something.** There is no fixed roster of rows with
zeros in it — a thread that has never called a tool has no tool-results row, a catalog
with no connected MCP servers has no row for them, and each appears the moment it starts
costing the window. A readout of the things that are actually there is scanned; a form
with a row for everything that could be there is read.

**It is an estimate anchored to a fact.** Every piece is sized with the coarse
characters-per-token proxies the rest of the codebase already uses for soft budgets
(``core.text``, one rate for prose and a denser one for serialized structure), and then
scaled so they sum to exactly the token count the provider reported. The total is
therefore always right and the split is approximately right — which is the honest shape
of the thing, and why every figure the UI renders from this carries a `~`. Scaling also
absorbs what the proxy can't see (per-message framing, special tokens, a tokenizer that
isn't four-chars-a-token) by spreading it across the parts in proportion, rather than
letting it pile up in whichever part happens to be measured last.
