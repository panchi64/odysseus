"""The thread actions this installation ships with.

Data, not code — the same discipline ``services/subagents/roster`` keeps, and for the same
reason: these are a list of names with descriptions, and the moment one of them is a
function the list stops being readable as a list.

**An action names an id, never a route.** Each of these already has a control in the
interface and a relay behind it; a command is a second way to reach the one that exists,
so what the catalog carries is the id the client maps onto that relay. ``new-thread`` is
the case that settles the shape: it navigates and calls nothing, so a method-and-path
record would have had to carry an empty one.

**Which of these a given request may use is not decided here.** An action needing a
conversation is useless in a composer that has none, and the route is what knows whether
there is one — see ``registry``. This file says what exists.
