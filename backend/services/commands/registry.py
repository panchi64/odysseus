"""Every command this request may offer, and what a picked one resolves to.

The registry owns two questions and no others: *which names exist right now*, and *which
spec a typed name means*. What a resolved command then does to the turn is
``expand``'s; what an action does is the client's, over a relay it already has.

**Five sources, one shape.** What the installation ships (thread actions, the built-in
sub-agent roster), what the operator wrote (published skills, saved workflows), and what the
project declared (``.claude/commands/*.md``, ``.claude/agents/*.md``). None of them exists
for this menu's sake; each is something the platform already had, given a name that can be
typed.

**Availability is decided here, never in the picker.** Three things narrow the catalog and
all three are facts only the backend holds: a sub-agent command is pointless where
``subagents_launch`` has been withheld (the operator's own switch, offline mode, the
thread's mode — ``services/tool_policy`` unions them), an action that acts on a
conversation is pointless in a composer that has none, and a mode-scoped command is
pointless outside its mode. A client that filtered any of these would be deciding, and it
would be deciding from a stale copy.

**A collision drops nothing.** Sources are merged by locality — what the installation
ships, then what the operator wrote, then what the project declared — but the loser stays
in the catalog carrying ``shadowed_by``, because a skill and a sub-agent both called
``reviewer`` are two real things and the picker's job is to show the operator that. Only
the *bare* name resolves to one of them; ``/skill:reviewer`` still reaches the other.

    that name, because a repository that has written down how *its* reviewer works knows
    something this installation cannot. That is also what ``tools/project_agents.run_roster``
    does at launch, so the name the picker offers and the sub-agent that actually starts are
    resolved the same way — which is the only reason it is safe for the command's block to
    name a sub-agent by name and stop there.

    ``run_roster`` reads a project's declarations only in a worktree mode; offering them in a
    sandbox thread would put a row in the menu whose launch resolves to nothing, and the
    operator would meet that as a failed tool call mid-turn rather than as an absent option.
    A thread files under a project in every mode, so a root alone is not the question.

    One residual, inherent rather than fixable here: in a worktree mode before the thread's
    first turn, ``root`` is still the operator's own checkout, so an agent file they have not
    committed is offered and will not be in the worktree the launcher resolves against. The
    command carries only the *name*, which is what makes that recoverable — the same
    uncommitted-work gap code mode already has, rather than a new one.
