"""Turning a picked command into the block that rides this turn.

**The operator's literal text stays their turn.** ``/review the auth route`` is what
persists and what the transcript renders; what this module builds is appended to the
*tail* of the same turn's user prompt, announced as a context injection, and stripped
before the turn is recorded (``agent/prelude``, ``services/conversations``'s
``install_persisted_attachments``). Three consequences worth holding on to:

* A command body **never enters history**. It is re-derived each turn it applies to, so
  editing a skill changes what the next invocation does rather than leaving an old copy
  replayed forever.
* It never touches the request *head*, so the cached prefix survives a command that
  differs on every turn.
* The Auto reviewer reads position 0 of a user part and explicitly refuses to join the
  tail (``services/permissions/reviewer``), so nothing written here can wear the
  operator's label in a review. That is the property that makes it safe to put a
  project-declared template in this block at all.

**Skills and sub-agents are reached by directive, not by invocation.** Both already have
one tested path — ``skills_open`` and ``subagents_launch`` — carrying staging, the
published-only check, permission folding and the approval gate. A second path that opened
or launched from here would have to reproduce all of it, and in the sub-agent's case would
produce one with no parent turn to report into. So the block says what the operator asked
for and the model makes the call it would have made anyway.

    its instruction files already live under.
