"""What a slash command *is*, as data.

A command is not a new kind of thing. It is a **name the operator can type** that resolves
to something the platform already has — a published skill, a sub-agent on the roster, a
thread action that already has a route, and later a prompt template of their own. So this
record carries no behaviour: it says which source answered, what to show in the picker, and
the one handle (``target`` or ``action``) the resolver needs to do the rest.

**Two names, and the second is why nothing is ever dropped.** ``name`` is what the operator
types; ``qualified_name`` prefixes it with the source. A skill, a workflow and a sub-agent
may all legitimately be called ``reviewer`` — three real things, and deleting two of them
because the third took the name is a data-loss bug wearing a precedence rule. So all three
ship in the catalog, ``/reviewer`` resolves the winner, and ``/agent:reviewer`` resolves
exactly.

**Precedence is locality, extended rather than re-invented.** ``services/subagents/roster``
already says a project's declaration beats the one this installation ships, because a
repository that has written down how *its* reviewer works knows something we do not. The
same ordering applies one level up, across sources: what the installation ships loses to
what the operator wrote, which loses to what the project declared.
