"""Commands a project declares for itself, in its own files.

A repository that has written down how *its* release notes get drafted knows something this
installation cannot, and the convention for writing it down already exists: a markdown file
with YAML frontmatter under ``.claude/commands/``, the shape Claude Code reads. So a project
command is not a fifth kind of thing. It is a :class:`CommandSpec` built from a file instead
of from a database row, and past this module nothing can tell the two apart.

This mirrors ``services/subagents/definitions`` beat for beat, on purpose — same asset scan,
same per-file skip, same name rule, same caps — because they are the same job over a
different directory, and a project whose ``agents/`` files load while its ``commands/`` files
quietly do not would be impossible to explain.

**A bad file is skipped, never fatal.** These are hand-written, they arrive with a checkout,
and nobody editing one is watching this process. A file that cannot be read costs its own
command and nothing else.

**Worktree modes only**, which is enforced by the spec's ``modes`` rather than here: a
sandbox thread has no repository to have declared anything, and a picker offering a command
whose body came from a checkout the thread cannot see would be offering nothing.

    the case where the file is named for its contents rather than for its handle.

    Frontmatter is **optional here**, unlike an agent file — which is why a
    ``FrontmatterError`` reads as "no frontmatter" rather than as a broken file. A command is
    a prompt; the smallest useful one in the wild is a body with nothing above it, and
    demanding a description for a name only the operator can type would be ceremony for its
    own sake. An agent file cannot do the same, because its description is the only thing the
    model reads when choosing one — nobody chooses a command but the person typing it.
