"""What makes a written command well-formed — the rules, once, for both authors of one.

A workflow arrives from two places: the operator typing into the settings pane, and a
markdown file in a checkout under ``.claude/commands/``. They are the same thing with
different provenance, they land in the same picker, and a rule that held for one and not
the other would be a name the operator could write in a file but not in the form.

So the caps and the name rule live here and both callers run them. What differs between the
two is only **how a violation is reported**: the store raises, because someone is looking at
a form and waiting to be told; the file scan catches and skips, because nobody is watching a
checkout while the model is mid-turn (``services/subagents/definitions`` makes the same
split for the same reason).

**Why the caps are where they are.** A description is one line in a picker and joins no
prompt, so it is bounded for the operator's eyes rather than for a budget. The *body* is the
one field that reaches the model, once per turn it is invoked on, at the tail — so its cap
is the one that matters, and it is set beside the sub-agent brief's rather than invented:
both are operator-authored prose that rides one turn, and there is no reason for a command
template to be allowed to be larger than an agent's whole standing instruction.
