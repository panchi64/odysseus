"""Uploads — accept files, extract their text, and make both retrievable.

The capability behind `UP-1`/`UP-2`. An upload is encrypted at rest (its bytes,
filename, and extracted text); the operator owns it, so reads come back decrypted.
What the store keeps true:

- **Duplicates are recognized** (`UP-1`). A file's content ``sha256`` is the dedup
  key: re-uploading identical bytes returns the existing upload instead of storing a
  second copy. ``create`` reports which happened so the route can say so.
- **Text is extracted off the request path** (`UP-2`). A new upload is born ``queued``;
  a lock-aware :class:`~core.worker.WriteBehindWorker` drains it — decrypt the bytes,
  run the :class:`~services.upload_extraction.UploadExtractor` (native PDF text, vision
  OCR for scanned pages), seal the result — moving it ``extracting`` → ``done``/``error``.
  The worker seals content, so it parks while the vault is locked.
- **Extracted text is corpus content and correctable.** After a successful extraction
  (and after any operator correction) the store hands the text to the
  :class:`~services.corpus.uploads.UploadsAdapter` to (re)index, so the agent retrieves
  it through ``corpus.retrieve``. Deleting an upload drops its chunks.

Like the document store, *search* is not a method here — it flows through the corpus's
hybrid recall, not a hand-rolled scan over decrypted text.
