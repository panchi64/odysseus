"""HostOpen — hand a path on the operator's own machine to whatever opens it there.

Why this is a backend service at all: a browser cannot open a local file. ``file://``
navigation is blocked from a page, and it would be the wrong thing even if it weren't —
the operator wants the file in their editor, not rendered in a tab. The process that can
do it is the one already running on their machine, so a click on a path in an answer
becomes a REST call and the OS picks the application.

**Operator-initiated, never agent-initiated.** This is the mirror image of
``services/host_picker``: that one reads a path off the desktop, this one acts on one,
and both are reachable only from a control the operator pressed. The same guard enforces
it (``tests/test_host_surface_guard.py``) — nothing under ``tools/`` or ``agent/`` may
reference either. A model that could launch applications on the host would be acting
outside every approval gate, and here it would do it by *naming a path in its own prose*,
which is the only input this feature takes.

That is why :func:`resolve_within` exists and why the route hands it the operator's own
project roots. The path arrives from a click on model-written text, so it is untrusted
content and containment is the whole gate — the same ``contained_path`` every file tool
is fenced by, not a second check written out again here.

**Portable by construction** (`XC-PORT-1`): ``open`` on macOS, ``explorer`` on Windows,
``xdg-open`` or ``gio`` elsewhere, and nothing at all on a headless host — where the call
fails with a sentence saying so, because a path shown in prose is still worth reading as
text when nothing can open it.

Each helper is spawned with a **fixed argv and no shell**: the path is one argument and
is never interpolated into a command line.

    ``path`` is whatever the model wrote into its answer, so both spellings it uses have
    to work and neither may be trusted: the absolute path a code thread is told its files
    are called, and the workspace-relative one its file tools take. Both go through the
    sandbox's own containment check, which is what makes one loop enough: ``root /
    "/etc/passwd"`` *is* ``/etc/passwd`` and ``root / "../../.ssh/id_rsa"`` resolves out
    of the tree, so the function every file tool is already fenced by refuses both —
    rather than a second check written out here and drifting from the first.

    The first root that both contains the path and has something at it wins, which makes
    the caller's ordering the policy rather than a rule buried here: the route puts the
    active project first, and each project's worktree ahead of the operator's own
    checkout, so a file the agent just wrote opens as the copy it actually wrote.

    Refusals are two different answers on purpose. Contained but absent is a stale path
