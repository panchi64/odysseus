"""The static catalog of connector presets (`INTEG-1`).

A **preset** is everything the system knows about a third-party service before the
operator supplies anything: where it lives, how it authenticates, one request that proves
a credential works (`INTEG-3`), and the handful of actions worth exposing to the agent.
The operator's row (``models.external_tool.Integration``) then holds only their choices —
the label, the base URL if theirs differs, and the sealed credential.

Why a catalog rather than "point at any URL": an action's *shape* is what makes it
callable by a model with typed arguments and reviewable by an operator at approval time.
A generic "make an HTTP request" tool would collapse every connector into one
undifferentiated capability, which is precisely the thing `AE-3.6`'s per-tool trust is
meant to keep separable.

Presets here are **public-cloud services on purpose.** Every outbound request is
SSRF-guarded (`core/ssrf`), which refuses loopback/private/link-local targets, so a
LAN-only connector could not be reached even if it were listed.
