"""Third-party connectors (`INTEG-1`…`INTEG-3`).

Two pieces: :mod:`services.integrations.presets` is the static catalog — what the system
knows about a service before the operator supplies anything (address, auth shape, a
credential-proving request, the actions worth exposing) — and
:mod:`services.integrations.service` owns the operator's side: configure from a preset with
the credential sealed, test it, call an action, and the per-action enable/trust decisions
that ride the shared :mod:`services.external_tools` policy store.
