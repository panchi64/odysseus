"""Building a live MCP client from a registered server row.

**We do not hand-roll an MCP client.** Pydantic AI ships ``MCPToolset``, which speaks the
full protocol over any transport and *is* an ``AbstractToolset`` — so a connected server
drops straight into the same stack every built-in category rides. This module only
translates a stored row into the right transport; the library does the rest.

Two conventions the rest of the track depends on:

- **The toolset comes back un-prefixed.** Discovery wants the tool names the server
  actually publishes, and those names are what the per-tool policy rows are keyed by. The
  agent-facing prefix (``{slug}_``) is applied one layer up, where the tools are composed.
- **Credentials become transport auth, not tool arguments.** For the HTTP transports they
  are turned into request headers here. A stdio server has no headers: its auth channel is
  the sealed ``env`` map the operator supplies, so credentials are not applied to it.
