"""The registry of external MCP tool servers (`MCP-1`, `MCP-3`).

Owns the operator's side of an MCP connection: register a server, dial it and discover
what it exposes, keep the last outcome so the surface can say *why* something is down,
reconnect, disable, and remove. It does **not** own the protocol — ``client.py`` hands
back a Pydantic AI MCP toolset and that library speaks MCP.

Two properties worth keeping in mind when changing this:

- **Discovery writes catalog, never policy.** A connect refreshes the cached tool list; it
  never creates or flips an :class:`~models.external_tool.ExternalToolPolicy` row. Trust
  is only ever an operator action (`AE-3.6`), so a server that starts exposing a new tool
  gets that tool approval-gated by default rather than inheriting anything.
- **A dead server is a status, not an exception.** ``connect`` records the failure on the
  row and returns; nothing about one unreachable server may break the surface, and the
  agent path skips servers that aren't currently connected.

Raises domain errors only (`NotFoundError`, `InvalidInputError`,
`DegradedCapabilityError`); `core.http_errors` maps them to HTTP.
