"""HostPicker — a native file/folder chooser on the operator's own machine.

Why this is a backend service at all: a browser cannot produce an absolute host path.
``<input type="file">`` hands over bytes with no location, and the File System Access API
is Chromium-only and still path-less. But some fields need a real path — a project
directory on the operator's own disk, read *where it is*. So the dialog is opened by the
process that runs on their machine, and the chosen path comes back as data.

**Progressive enhancement, never a requirement.** Every surface that uses this also takes
a typed path, and :func:`probe` tells the UI whether to offer the button at all — a
headless host simply doesn't show it. That keeps the platform rule intact (`XC-PORT-1`):
no OS-specific facility is load-bearing for any core function, and the helpers below are
a convenience layer that degrades to typing.

**Agent-unreachable by construction**: imported only by its route and the app wiring,
never by ``tools/`` or ``agent/`` (enforced by
``tests/test_host_picker_guard.py``). A model that could open host dialogs — or read back
arbitrary paths — would be reaching outside every approval gate.

Each helper is spawned with a **fixed argv and no shell**, and the path it prints is
treated as data: it is returned to the caller and never interpolated into a command.
