"""``MailTransport`` — the pluggable seam every mail provider implements.

The same shape as the two seams already in `services/`: an explicit ``Protocol`` (like
:class:`~services.upload_extraction.UploadExtractor`) that the layers above program
against, with one adapter per backend (like ``services/serving/adapters/``). IMAP+SMTP,
JMAP, Gmail and Microsoft Graph are then interchangeable, and a test drives the whole
service against a fake that implements nothing but this protocol.

Two rules make the seam worth having:

1. **Domain models only.** Every method returns the dataclasses in
   :mod:`services.mail.models` — never an ``aioimaplib`` response, a JMAP blob, or a REST
   dict. Nothing above this file knows which provider it is talking to.
2. **Domain errors only.** Failures surface as :mod:`services.mail.errors` types, so the
   route layer maps them to HTTP and the tool layer decides retry-vs-degrade.
