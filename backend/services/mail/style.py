"""The operator's writing style, learned from Sent mail — and the replies drafted in it
(`EMAIL-3`).

Two halves of one idea:

- **Learn.** A pass over the account's Sent folder distills how the operator actually
  writes — greeting and sign-off habits, length, formality, quirks — into a short prose
  profile stored sealed and, crucially, **shown to the operator and editable by them**.
  A hand-edited profile is never silently overwritten by a later learn pass: the
  operator's own description of their voice outranks an inference from a sample.
- **Draft.** A reply suggestion is generated from the message being answered, the prior
  exchange with that sender, and the profile.

The safety line is the same as triage's (`XC-SEC-5`), and it matters more here because the
output is prose the operator may send: the incoming message and the prior context are
**someone else's words**, so they are fenced as untrusted data. Only the profile — the
operator's own text — sits outside the fence. A draft is never sent by this module; it is
stored for the operator to review, and the agent's send path is approval-gated regardless.
