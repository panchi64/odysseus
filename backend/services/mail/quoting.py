"""Separating a reply from what it quotes, and from its signature (`EMAIL-4`).

A mail body is usually three things stacked: the sender's new prose, the history they
quoted under it, and a signature block. The reader wants only the first, triage should
summarize only the first, and a generated reply should imitate only the operator's own
signature — so the split is done once, at ingest, and stored on the cached row.

Two layers, cheapest first:

- ``email_reply_parser`` splits the body into fragments and labels each quoted or
  signature. It is battle-tested against the ill-specified reality of quote headers
  ("On … wrote:", ``>`` prefixes, Outlook's ``-----Original Message-----``), which is
  exactly the part not worth re-deriving.
- A small signature pass on top, because the parser only recognizes a signature by the
  RFC 3676 ``-- ``/``__`` delimiter (or "Sent from my …"). When no delimiter is present, a
  short trailing block introduced by a common sign-off is taken as one.

Both are conservative: when nothing matches confidently the whole body stays in ``reply``,
because wrongly hiding real prose is far worse than showing a signature.
