"""Automatic triage of incoming mail (`EMAIL-2`) — summarize, categorize, rank, flag spam.

One structured call on the **utility** model per new message: a short summary, a category
tag, an urgency verdict, a spam judgement, and any calendar events the message implies
(`EMAIL-4`). Urgent, non-spam mail then raises a notification through the attention
surface, so the operator learns about it away from the inbox.

**The message body is untrusted input, and that is the whole security posture of this
module** (`XC-SEC-5`). Mail is the one ingress an attacker fully controls: they choose the
words, and those words go straight into a model prompt. So every body — and every subject
and sender name — is fenced with :func:`core.untrusted.wrap_untrusted` before it reaches
the model, and the model is asked for *typed* output rather than free prose, so even a
successful injection can only move a category label, never issue an instruction.

The prompt lives here rather than in ``prompts/`` because it is not a standing agent
instruction: it is this capability's own one-shot schema-bound request, meaningless
outside it, and it is versioned with the verdict type it fills in.
