"""The deferred sweep that writes each thread's work summary.

A summary of what the agent did in a conversation is worth writing exactly once the work
has stopped moving. That makes it the opposite shape from auto-titling, which is settled
inside the first turn: there is no moment during a turn at which "what this thread did" is
a finished question, so this hangs off a timer instead and asks it of threads that have
been quiet for a while (:func:`services.settings_store.get_work_summary_idle_minutes`, the
operator's own dial).

Three things the sweep refuses to do, each of which would be a real defect rather than
merely wasted work:

- **It does not run while the vault is locked.** The history it would read and the summary
  it would write are both sealed, so there is no key and nothing to do — the pass returns
  immediately rather than raising its way through a decrypt, the same posture
  :class:`services.scheduler.SchedulerService` takes for the same reason.
- **It does not summarize a thread with a live run.** The registry is asked before each
  candidate, because "idle for fifteen minutes" is measured off ``updated_at``, which a
  run that has not persisted its turn yet has not moved. A summary written under a
  streaming answer would describe the thread as it was before the turn it is watching.
- **It does not empty the queue in one pass.** A workspace full of threads that predate the
  feature is a backfill, not an emergency: the candidate query is capped
  (``work_summary_max_per_sweep``) so the first sweep after an upgrade spreads its model
  calls over several minutes rather than firing one per thread at the background endpoint
  at once. Ordering by most-recently-active means the threads the operator might actually
  re-enter are the ones that get done first.

Failure is per-thread and never fatal: :func:`agent.work_summary.summarize_work` is
best-effort and returns ``None``, and anything raised around one candidate is logged and
the rest of the pass continues. The loop itself is a :class:`harness.PeriodicTask`, so a
pass that fails outright leaves the loop up.
