"""Sealing a column that used to be stored in the clear (`XC-SEC-3`).

Adding at-rest encryption to a field that already has rows is not a migration problem —
it is a **lock problem**. ``core/db.init_db`` upgrades to head at startup, *before* any
login, so a migration runs with the vault locked and no key: it can add the sealed column
but it cannot fill it. The established answer is the one ``_backfill_embeddings`` and the
lock-aware ``WriteBehindWorker`` already take — do the key-needing work in the background
**after unlock**.

That makes a converting column live in two states at once, so this module owns both
halves of the pattern:

- :func:`open_sealed` — the **read**. Prefer the sealed value; fall back to the legacy
  cleartext while it is still there. A half-migrated database therefore reads correctly
  from the first request, before the backfill has touched a single row — never a garbled
  string, never a missing one.
- :func:`seal_legacy_column` — the **heal**. Once unlocked, seal every row that still has
  cleartext and **clear the legacy column in the same write**, so the plaintext stops
  existing rather than merely being ignored. Idempotent, so a re-run after a crash
  finishes the job instead of double-sealing.

New sensitive fields don't need any of this — they are sealed from their first write. This
is only for the columns that predate their own encryption.
