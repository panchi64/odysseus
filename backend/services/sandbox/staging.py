"""Staging an operator's file into a conversation's sandbox workspace.

One implementation, two callers. A file the operator attaches to a message is written
into the conversation's sandbox ``/work`` so the agent can *read and compute on it*
rather than have its text poured into the model's context:

- **eagerly, at attach time** (``agent/attachments.py``) — the turn's marker names the
  path, and the model pages through the file itself;
- **on demand** (``tools/attachments.py``'s ``attachments_provision``) — the recovery
  path when a recycled session no longer holds the file, or when the agent wants an
  attachment from an older turn.

Both land on the same path for the same bytes, which is the point: the marker written on
the attach turn stays correct after a re-stage, so a replayed thread doesn't have to
learn a second filename.
