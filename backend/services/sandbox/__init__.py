"""Execution-sandbox capability — where the agent's code runs, and what it may reach.

The default is the container path (``Sandbox`` + ``ContainerSandbox``), reached
through a per-conversation :class:`SandboxSessionManager` that keeps a container
warm for iterative work and reaps it when idle. What that container may reach is
decided at its network edge, not by its walls: an ``--internal`` network whose only
exit is the allowlisting proxy in ``sidecar``.

``host`` is the other half — the OS-level confinement everything that runs *outside*
a container is wrapped in, reading the same domain allowlist. Two callers land there:
the code-mode shell, which refuses without a fence, and the approval-gated escape
hatch for when the operator's own machine has to change, which degrades and says so.
