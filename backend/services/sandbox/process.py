"""Running a command on the operator's real machine, and reaping the tree it starts.

Two paths land here — the code-mode shell and ``code_run_host_command``, the approval-gated
escape hatch — and they differ only in what they do with the streams afterwards. The
mechanics live beside the fence rather than inside it (``host.py``) so that *what a command
may reach* and *how a process is started and killed* have separate reasons to change.

Nothing here decides the first of those. Every caller rewrites its command through
:func:`services.sandbox.host.confine` before it gets this far. What this module guarantees
is that whatever was started can be stopped **whole** — a command that backgrounds a
server must not leave it running once the run that started it is gone.

    its own environment to get one of them would silently lose the other. That is not
    hypothetical: passing the git pins in as an explicit ``env`` is exactly how the
    credential filter came to be skipped on the host hatch.

    **The operator's model credentials are removed.** Not a boundary — a same-user process
    can reach the parent's environment through the OS — but the fence denies the paths
    those keys are *stored* at, and this keeps them out of the one place a command reads
    for free. A key denied to the shell and handed to the approved host command would be
    the same secret guarded on one route and not the other.

    **The git settings a repository must not choose for us are pinned over it**
    (``gitenv.py``) — otherwise `git status` in a cloned worktree runs whatever that
    repository's own config names as a filesystem monitor, and a pager blocks on a pipe.
    Applied over the *filtered* environment, so an operator already passing git settings
    this way is continued rather than overwritten and the two rules compose in one
