"""Pinning the git settings a repository must not be allowed to choose for us.

A repository's own `.git/config` is **content**, not configuration: in a worktree it is
the *main checkout's* file, and anything the agent — or a build script it ran — writes
into it lands there. Several of its keys name a program git then executes as part of an
ordinary read: `core.fsmonitor` runs a hook on `git status`, and a pager is launched for
anything that prints. So a command that looks like an observation, and is cleared as one,
can execute whatever a repository put in that file.

Git's answer is `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` / `GIT_CONFIG_KEY_n` / `GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_n`: settings
handed in through the environment, applied *after* every config file, so they win. That is
why the pins live here rather than in a `git -c` prefix — a prefix only covers the one
invocation someone remembered to write it on, and every command in this application's
shells is git's caller whether it says `git` or not (`make`, a test suite, a build script).

Two keys — the ones that turn a read into an execution *and* have a value that means "do
not":

- ``core.fsmonitor=false`` — no hook program on a status/diff of a working tree;
- ``core.pager=cat`` — a pager is a program too, and it would block on a pipe besides.

**What is missing from that list cannot be put there.** `diff.external`, a diff driver's
`textconv` and a filter driver's `clean`/`smudge` each run a program during an ordinary
`git diff`, `git log -p`, `git blame` — even `git status`, which runs the clean filter to
decide whether a file changed. No *value* switches them off: git reads these keys as
command lines, so the empty string is not an absence but a program named "", and pinning
``diff.external=`` makes **every** `git diff` die with `cannot run : No such file or
directory` (git 2.50), in a clean repository as readily as a poisoned one. The driver
keys cannot even be named from here — the driver's name is whatever the repository's own
`.gitattributes` says. Blanking the attributes wholesale (``GIT_ATTR_SOURCE`` at the
empty tree) does stop all three, and stops git-lfs and end-of-line normalisation with
them: it would trade a repository that can run a program for a repository the agent
silently commits raw blobs into.

**So those keys are the fence's to answer, and it does.** ``fence.py`` bounds what a
spawned program may *do* — which is the only formulation that covers a program the
repository named, a program the build named, and a program nobody named — instead of
guessing what git might be asked to run. What the pins below still buy is the case the
fence cannot see: they keep a poisoned `core.fsmonitor` from being *launched* at all, and
they keep a pager from blocking on a pipe. Two keys, and nothing about the drivers.
