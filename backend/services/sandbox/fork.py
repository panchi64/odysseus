"""A delegated agent's own copy of the workspace, and what comes back from it.

A child agent does not share its parent's container: sharing one means two agents
writing the same files with no record of who wrote what, and a parent that cannot tell
its own work from the work it asked for. So the child gets a **fork** — the parent's
whole workspace, copied — runs in its own container behind its own fence, and the parent
decides afterwards what to keep.

**The copy keeps everything the seal throws away.** ``.venv``, ``node_modules``,
``.local``: an archive drops them because they are rebuildable, but rebuilding them is
minutes the delegated agent would spend before its first useful command. Cloned
copy-on-write where the filesystem allows (:func:`core.fork.clone_tree`), so warmth is
close to free.

**The merge back is three-way, and it never overwrites.** A fork records the parent's
files as they stood the moment it was taken; a file the child changed lands only if the
parent's copy still matches that record. If both moved, the path is reported as a
conflict and the parent's version is left exactly as it is — a delegated agent's edit
silently clobbering work the parent did while it ran is the one outcome this whole shape
exists to prevent. Deletions are reported and never applied for the same reason: the
child dropping a file is not evidence the parent wanted it gone.

**A forked workspace is never sealed.** It is a copy of a workspace that is already
archived under its parent's key, so an archive of it would be a second at-rest copy of
the same files under a key no conversation will ever ask for again. The marker
(:func:`fork_marker`) is what tells the idle sweep that — it survives a crash, which is
the only moment anything else would find such a directory.
