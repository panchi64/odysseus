"""Reading back the archives written while a reap still sealed the workspace.

A workspace used to live as a plaintext directory while its container was up and as
one vault-sealed tar the rest of the time. It no longer does — a reap stops the
container and leaves the directory alone — but an installation that ran the old
build still has archives on disk, and they hold conversations' real work.

So this module is the one-way door out of that format: **restore only, and delete the
archive once it has landed.** Nothing writes one any more. Every path here is dead the
moment no installation carries a `sandbox/sealed/` entry, and the whole file can go
then.
