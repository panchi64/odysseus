"""The deliberate host-execution escape hatch — the one non-sandboxed path.

This is the exception to everything its sibling modules enforce: it runs a command
**directly on the host**. It exists for the legitimate case where the operator
genuinely needs their own machine changed. It is therefore reachable by the agent
*only* through an approval-gated tool whose request carries a plain-language
explanation of what the command does — never as a silent fallback, never without
explicit per-call consent. Kept here, beside the sandbox, so both execution paths
live in one place and the contrast is impossible to miss.

**Approval is not the only thing holding the line.** What the operator read and agreed
to is the command; what a command can *reach* once running is a separate question, and
one they cannot audit from a single line of shell. So an approved command is also fenced
at the OS level — ``sandbox-runtime`` (seatbelt on macOS, bubblewrap on Linux, no
container) denies reads of the credential paths and the data directory, and allows egress
only to configured domains.

**This one degrades where the sandbox fails closed, deliberately.** ``detect.py`` disables
sandboxed execution outright when no runtime exists, because nothing was promised there.
Here the operator has explicitly approved *this* command, and refusing it because a
platform primitive is missing would break the single case the tool exists for. So a
missing primitive means the command runs unconfined and says so, rather than not running.

    Neither obvious answer is usable. The server process's own working directory is the
    application's source tree — its `.env`, its config, its database url — so a command
    approved to read "a file here" would be reading those, and every relative path the
    model wrote would mean something in a directory nobody described to it. The run's
    workspace is no better: a `normal`/`research` thread's is inside ``data_dir``, which
    the fence below denies outright, so a command started there cannot resolve its own
    working directory, let alone write in it.

    So host commands get a scratch directory of their own: under the OS temp root, which
    the fence allows writing to; holding nothing the operator did not put there through
    this tool; and stable across calls, so one command's output is still there for the
    next — which is the one property the old server-directory behaviour had.

    **Stable and predictable under a shared root is a squattable pair**, so the path is
    claimed rather than merely created — see :func:`_claim_scratch`. This matters on Linux,
    where ``gettempdir()`` is the world-writable ``/tmp`` (macOS gives each user a private
    ``TMPDIR`` under ``/var/folders``), and it matters twice over: the directory is both
    where every approved command starts *and* an entry in the fence's write allowlist, so
    whoever controls it controls what a relative path in an approved command resolves to.
