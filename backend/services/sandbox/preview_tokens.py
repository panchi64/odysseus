"""Which token names which conversation's preview, and why a dead one died.

The proxy route and the live-status route both arrive holding nothing but an opaque
token, and both need an answer that outlives the thing it refers to: a preview torn down
by the idle reaper has to read as *stopped* rather than as *never existed*, or the
frontend cannot tell "the sandbox went idle and killed your server" from an iframe that
is merely still loading.

So this keeps two maps rather than one. The live index is authoritative only while the
session is; the tombstones are what remains afterwards, and they are pruned by age
because a token nobody has asked about in an hour is one nobody is going to. Explicit
closes are deliberately *not* tombstoned — the close already emits its own event, and a
client that asked for the teardown does not need to be told it happened twice.

Bookkeeping only: nothing here starts, stops, or touches a container. The manager owns
that, and calls in here to record what it did.
