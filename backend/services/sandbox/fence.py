"""The OS fence a worktree command runs inside, built per call from what it declared.

``host.py`` fences the *host* escape hatch — one profile, configured once, denying the
credential paths and the data directory. This builds a **narrower** profile for a command
the deterministic stage cleared (``services/permissions/judge.py``): writes confined to
the worktree, egress either off entirely or limited to the operator's allowed domains, and
the repository's own metadata protected by path rather than by a table of git subcommands.

**Why the fence is what made the allowlist unnecessary.** A read-only program table has to
answer "what will this binary do", and for the commands that matter it cannot: `git status`
runs whatever a repository's `.gitattributes` names as a clean filter, `git diff` runs
`diff.external`, and no flag and no environment pin states either rule (``gitenv.py`` says
why). Bounding what a *spawned program may do* answers all of them at once, and answers
them for `make`, `npm run` and a test suite too — none of which any table could have
enumerated. So the tier the judge assigns names a profile here, and the tool that executes
the call builds it: what runs can never exceed what was declared.

**It lives beside the host confinement rather than with the judge**, because it imports
``sandbox_runtime`` and reads the filesystem, and the judge is pure. The judge decides
*whether*; this decides *what the boundary is*.

**Deny beats allow in both runtimes**, and the profiles below are written for that. On
macOS the generated seatbelt profile emits every allow rule before every deny rule and the
last match wins (``sandbox_runtime/macos_sandbox.py``); on Linux a denied path is re-bound
read-only over the writable bind (``linux_sandbox.py``). So a narrow allow *inside* a broad
deny is not a thing that can be expressed — the sibling paths are listed explicitly
instead, and writes are deny-by-default, so what is not named is already denied.

**Linux binds paths that exist.** ``bwrap`` skips a bind whose source is missing, so a
lock file git has not created yet cannot be allowed by name there; the directory holding it
is allowed instead, which is wider (every branch ref rather than this thread's) and is the
platform's price for a `git commit` that works. macOS matches on the path string and needs
no such widening, so it does not get it.

**What this bounds, and what it does not.** Writes are deny-by-default with an allowlist,
and egress is allowlist-only — those two are the fence's, and they hold whatever a command
does once it is running. **Reads are not**: ``sandbox_runtime``'s filesystem config carries
a read *denylist* and no read allowlist at all, so a fenced command can still read anything
on the host outside the paths named in ``deny_read``. Reads are therefore bounded upstream
or not at all — the structural stage refuses a command that names a path outside the
worktree, and refuses a word it cannot place as a single path
(``services/permissions/shell_ast.py``). Nothing here is a second line under that one, and
a docstring implying otherwise would be the most expensive kind of wrong.

**Which is exactly why the `cd`-persistence shim is contained.** The shell session
remembers its working directory between calls, and the structural stage measures every
relative path against the *worktree root* — so a command that moved the tracked directory
outside the worktree would leave every later containment claim measured against the wrong
place, with nothing downstream to catch the reads. The shim below therefore steps into
what the fenced shell recorded only while it is still under the root
(:class:`CwdCapture`).

        None is not an error: a workspace that is not a git checkout is fenced to its own
        directory and nothing else, which is the right answer and needs no git paths at all.

        **The pointer is checked against the repository it claims rather than followed on
        trust, and that check is a security boundary.** ``<root>/.git`` is a file *inside*
        the worktree, so a command this fence cleared can rewrite it — and what it names
        becomes the **next** command's write allowlist. Without a check, two commands that
        each stay inside the worktree (write a line, copy it over `.git`) hand a third an
        allow on any directory on the host, which is the one thing the fence exists to make
        impossible. The check is git's own layout: a linked worktree's private directory is
        always ``<common>/worktrees/<name>``, so both halves of the pointer have to agree
        about which repository this is, and making them agree about a directory we may not
        already write means first creating a directory *inside* it — the very write being
        attempted. A pointer that does not describe that shape contributes no git paths at
        all: a commit then fails inside the fence, visibly and redeclarably, which is the
        cheap half of the trade.

        **Every way of being wrong ends as ``None``, and the file's *bytes* are one of the
        ways.** This runs on every shell call of a thread and no caller above it catches
        anything, so a pointer that raises would stop the tool working at all rather than
        stop it believing one file — and a hostile pointer is exactly where that would be

    land — the object store, the worktree's private metadata, and this thread's branch ref
    and reflog — and ``allow_write``, the operator's own additions
    (``Settings.worktree_command_allow_write``).

    ``allow_write`` is a *separate* setting from the host hatch's, and the asymmetry is the
    point: a host command is one the operator read and approved, so its list may be as
    broad as `~`; a `workspace` command is one nobody was asked about, so the same breadth
    here would be the fence dissolved. What it is seeded with is the build caches, which
    are the difference between this tier clearing `uv run pytest` and `uv run pytest`
    failing to initialise its cache — see the setting for what is deliberately left out.

    Denied inside what *is* writable: the host escape hatch's scratch directory, the
    repository's config, hooks, packed refs, ``info``, tags and remotes, and the two
    pointer files this profile was itself derived from (:func:`_pointer_writes`). The
    scratch directory is the cwd every operator-approved host command starts in and
    resolves its relative paths against, so a command that needed no approval must not be
    able to leave something in it. The git paths are named as paths rather than as git
    subcommands: `git config`, a shell redirect and a Python script are the same write.

    **How far "the operator's other branches are out of reach" actually goes.** In a linked
    worktree — the shape code mode always produces — the whole common directory is outside
    every allow, so another branch's ref is unreachable because nothing named it. In a plain
    checkout the common directory *is* ``<root>/.git``, inside the worktree allow, and the
    one ref a commit must write lives under ``refs/heads`` beside all the others: deny beats
    allow in both runtimes, so denying the parent would deny this thread's own branch too,
    and there is no third rule to write. So in that shape another branch stays writable, and
    saying so is better than a docstring that reads as a promise.

    ``allowed_domains`` is empty for ``workspace`` and the operator's list for ``network``.
    It can only *narrow*: the runtime filters proxied requests against the global config's
    own list, so a per-call list wider than that one buys nothing.

    ``deny_read`` is the host hatch's own list (``host.denied_read_paths``), restated
    because a per-call profile *replaces* the global one rather than narrowing it. Every
    entry is denied for writing too — read denial alone would still let a command clobber
    the vault or a key it could not read — mirroring what the host profile does.

    ``linux`` widens the branch-ref allows to their directories, because ``bwrap`` cannot
    bind a path that does not exist yet — see the module docstring.
