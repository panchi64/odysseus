"""The mechanics behind the code-mode shell: one persistent working directory, the
background processes started from it, and the fence every command is wrapped in.

**The behaviour is the harness `Shell`'s on purpose.** The model has been trained on those
four tools — their names, their arguments, the shape of what they return — and changing any
of it to gain a fence would cost more than the fence is worth. What is *not* the harness's
is the seam: it spawns processes itself, with nowhere to rewrite a command, and a code
conversation's shell has to run every command under OS confinement or not at all. So the
shape is copied and the spawn is ours. ``tools/shell.py`` keeps the model-facing contract;
what happens to a process is here.

The working directory persists between calls because a person's shell does, and because
the permission judge reads relative paths against it (``services/permissions/judge.py``).
It is captured out of band, into a temp file whose random name the agent's own command
cannot address: parsing a sentinel out of stdout would let any command that prints the
sentinel redirect where the next one runs.

**What a command hands back is structure, not a rendered string.** A run returns
:class:`ShellResult` — exit code, the two streams apart, whether it was killed on a
timeout, and how long it took — and a background command returns
:class:`BackgroundStatus`. It used to be one labelled string with `[stdout]` / `[stderr]`
/ `[exit code: N]` markers in it, which meant every reader downstream had to take the
markers back apart to get at a field: the operator's terminal card parsed them in the
browser, and a timed-out command threw its output away because there was no slot to put
it in. The prose a *model* reads is composed one layer up (``tools/shell.py``), from these
fields; nothing here decides how the result is worded.

**Output can be watched while it accumulates.** :meth:`FencedShell.run` takes an optional
``on_progress`` and calls it with whatever the command has newly printed, every
:data:`_PROGRESS_INTERVAL_S`. It is a hook and not an event: this module knows nothing
about runs or streams, and what a caller does with a chunk is theirs
(``tools/shell.py`` puts it on the operator's stream). Progress is best-effort in the
strong sense — a hook that raises, or a file that cannot be read, must never fail the
command that was running fine.
