"""What a walk of a workspace counts as part of it.

One question, asked by four readers who must agree: the fork's manifest, the merge
back, the history snapshot, and the per-turn workspace block the model reads. A walk
that kept a different set from another's would have the block advertising a file the
merge will not carry, or a fork reporting changes to files nothing else can see.

The exclusions here are **cosmetic and merge-safety only — nothing in this module
deletes anything.** A workspace's files stay on disk for as long as the conversation
does; what these names decide is which of them are worth *reporting*: a virtualenv
and a `node_modules` are thousands of files the agent did not write, and three-way
merging a `.git` directory's internals is corruption rather than continuity.

    Every *part* of the path is matched, not just its last one — so ``build`` skips
    ``packages/x/build/`` as readily as a top-level ``build/``. That breadth was a
    hazard while this list also decided what a reap threw away; now that a walk only
    decides what gets *reported*, it is simply the reading that keeps a nested
