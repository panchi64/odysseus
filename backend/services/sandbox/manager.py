"""The set of live sandboxes — who owns one, how many may exist, and when each goes.

One :class:`~services.sandbox.session.SandboxSession` is a single conversation's
container and workspace, and knows nothing about the others. Everything that is a
*policy over the set* lives here instead: mapping a conversation to its session,
the live-session cap, the idle reaper, the preview token index, purging a deleted
conversation, collecting the forks an unclean shutdown stranded, and forking a
session for a delegated agent (the copy and the merge themselves are
:mod:`services.sandbox.fork`'s; which key is the parent is a fact about the set).

The split follows the lock. A session's lock spans one call on one container; this
manager's lock guards the maps that decide which session a key even names, and the
tombstone protocol (``_tearing_down``) that keeps a second session from being minted
onto a workspace a teardown is still working through. Two locks with two jobs, and
neither file has a reason to change when the other's job does.

Reaping is about containers and nothing else. An ordinary conversation's workspace is
left on disk untouched, so a stranded *directory* is not a problem to solve — it is
simply that conversation's files, waiting. The one thing a crash can strand that
nobody will ever ask for again is a delegated agent's fork, and the idle sweep
collects those (:meth:`_collect_orphan_forks`). The containers and networks the same
crash left running are :mod:`services.sandbox.reconcile`'s, at boot, because that
needs none of this manager's state.
