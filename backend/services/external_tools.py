"""The shared layer under both external tool sources: how a tool is *named* and what the
operator has *decided* about it.

One policy store behind both external sources — MCP servers (`MCP-*`) and third-party
connectors (`INTEG-*`) — because the operator's two decisions about such a tool are the
same in both cases:

- **enabled** — is it offered to the agent at all (`MCP-1`, `AE-3.3`);
- **trusted** — may it run without pausing for approval (`AE-3.6`).

Both are keyed **per tool**. Enabling a server or configuring a connector says nothing
about what any individual tool on it does, so neither may imply trust; a server-level
flag would auto-approve tools the operator has never seen. Trust is granted one tool at a
time and revoked the same way.

A *missing* row is the safe default — ``enabled=True, trusted=False`` — so a tool the
server only just started exposing is usable but approval-gated, never silently trusted.

Policy, not content: nothing here is vault-sealed, exactly as ``ApprovalGrant`` isn't, so
it stays indexable and readable while the vault is locked. Raises domain errors only.

This module also holds :class:`ExternalTools` — the one handle carrying both sources and
this store, which is what the wiring hangs on ``app.state.external`` and what the tool
layer reads off ``RunDeps``.
