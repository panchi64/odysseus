"""What goes in a backup — discovered from the models, never listed here (`BACKUP-1`).

An entity declares its own membership with a ``__backup__`` marker (``models/_backup.py``).
This module walks the ``models`` package, collects the marked tables off SQLModel's mapper
registry, and orders them for import. The consequence that matters: **adding a table to the
backup is a one-line edit in that table's own file**, so features landing in parallel never
contend for a central list, and a table nobody marked is simply never exported.

The walk imports every ``models.*`` module for the same reason ``migrations/env.py`` does —
a class the process never imported has no mapper, and would silently vanish from exports.
