"""The backup file format — one file, encrypted under a **separate** backup secret.

`BACKUP-1` asks for a single file that carries no plainly-readable user data and that can be
decrypted on another host. The login-derived DEK cannot do that job: it never leaves this
machine and it is not something the operator can carry. So an export is sealed under a key
derived from a **recovery secret the operator supplies** — a passphrase or recovery key — and
that is the only thing needed to open it anywhere.

The file is JSON so it survives being mailed, copied, and stored anywhere text goes:

.. code-block:: json

    {"format": "odysseus-backup", "version": 1, "created_at": "…",
     "kdf": {"algorithm": "argon2id-kek-v1", "salt": "…"},
     "cipher": "AES-256-GCM", "payload": "<base64 nonce||ciphertext>"}

Everything outside ``payload`` is format bookkeeping — a salt and two algorithm names — and
no part of it is user data. The header is bound into the ciphertext as AEAD associated data,
so editing it (pointing the salt somewhere else, say) fails the open rather than silently
decrypting something else.

Derivation reuses ``core.crypto`` rather than reaching for Argon2 here: one place in the tree
knows how to stretch a secret into a key, and the ``argon2id-kek-v1`` tag records *which*
scheme a given file used, so a future change to those parameters can still open old backups.
