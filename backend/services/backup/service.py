"""Export and merge-import of the operator's data (`BACKUP-1`, `BACKUP-2`).

**Export** gathers every table that marked itself for backup (``services/backup/manifest``),
opens each sealed column with the login vault, and re-seals the whole payload under a
separate operator-supplied backup secret (``services/backup/envelope``). The result is one
file with no plainly-readable user data that opens on any other host with nothing but that
secret — the login password is neither needed there nor sufficient here.

**Import** merges. Every incoming record is stamped with the importing operator's
``owner_id`` (the ownership seam) and then tested twice before it is written: once against
the primary key, once against the surface's own natural key — a skill's name, a memory's
text, a preference's key — which is the same identity each surface already enforces in its
own unique constraints. Anything that matches is skipped, so importing the same file twice
changes nothing the second time, and importing a file from another host merges rather than
duplicates.

Ids are **preserved** across an import rather than reissued, which is what keeps a skill's
files attached to their skill and a role's fallback chain pointing at its endpoints. Where
that is not enough is a *skipped parent*: a skill the target already has under its own id
is not written, so every row still carrying the file's id for it would land pointing at a
row this host does not have — silently, since these references carry no foreign key. So the
merge threads an id remap through: a parent skipped in favour of a local twin records
file-id → local-id, and the rows that reference it are re-pointed before they are written.

Note what is deliberately *not* here: the secrets manager (``models/secret``) carries no
backup marker. Its whole point is a second lock; folding its entries into a file protected by
one operator-supplied secret would quietly undo that.
