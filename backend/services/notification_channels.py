"""Out-of-band notification channels — email and push (`AE-3.2`, `TASK-6`).

The in-app surface (`services/notifications.py`) is always on: everything the workspace
records shows up in the app. These channels are the *other* half — the ones that reach the
operator when the app isn't in front of them, which is the whole point of an unattended run
parking for approval (`AE-3.2`) or a reminder firing on its date (`TASK-6`).

Three rules shape the design:

- **A channel is a seam, not a hard-coded vendor.** :class:`NotificationChannel` is the
  whole contract — say whether you're configured, and deliver one notification. Email and
  push are the two implementations; an SMS or Matrix channel later is a new class here and
  nothing else.
- **A channel never breaks the thing that notified.** Delivery runs on the notification
  service's lock-aware drainer, off the critical path; a channel that is unconfigured or
  unreachable degrades to in-app-only rather than failing the park or the reminder.
- **Only interruption-worthy kinds leave the machine.** Every notification is in-app; only
  the kinds in :data:`OUT_OF_BAND_KINDS` are worth reaching for someone's phone over.

The push channel is deliberately a **webhook**, not a browser Web Push subscription: the
operator points it at whatever notifier they already run (ntfy, Gotify, Pushover, Home
Assistant, a Shortcuts endpoint), so a notification reaches a phone with the app closed and
no browser, no vendor account, and no service worker in the loop. Its URL is
operator-configured — the same trust level as the IMAP host they typed — so it is checked
for shape only and a LAN address is allowed on purpose, since a self-hosted notifier
usually *is* on the LAN. Nothing model-supplied ever reaches it.
