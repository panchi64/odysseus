"""Which files the operator's machine may be asked to open — the *type* half of the fence.

``services/host_open`` decides WHERE a path may point (inside the operator's own project
roots) and then hands it to the desktop's "open this with whatever handles it" program.
Location alone is not a gate: the agent *writes into* those roots, so a path can be
perfectly contained and still be a program. ``build-results.command`` on macOS,
``report.desktop`` on Linux, ``report.bat`` on Windows — each is a file an ordinary
workspace-write produces, which the model can then name in its own prose behind whatever
anchor text it likes ("click to view the results"), and which the host **executes** the
moment the operator clicks. Nothing else stands on that path: it is operator-initiated,
so no approval gate sees it.

So the type is fenced here, **deny-by-default**, because the feature's purpose is narrow —
the operator asked for the files being read to open in their editor. That is an allowlist
of text, source and documents, and anything it doesn't recognise costs a sentence rather
than a subprocess. A denylist of executable suffixes would be the wrong shape: it is
wrong the day a host registers a new one, and it is wrong *now* for the spellings a shell
normalises away (``report.md.``, ``report.md␠``, which resolve back to a neighbouring
file on Windows). An allowlist has no such holes — it matches exactly, or it refuses.

Two things a suffix cannot say, checked alongside it:

* **the execute bit** — ``notes.py`` with ``+x`` is a script the shell runs, and its
  extension is silent about that;
* **what the name is hung on** — a macOS application bundle (``Foo.app``,
  ``Foo.workflow``) is a *directory*, so a folder opens only when it carries no
  extension at all.

Deliberately not shared with ``corpus/folder``'s text-extension set, which looks like the
same list and must not become it: a crawler *should* index ``deploy.sh``, and this must
never hand one to a shell.

#: purpose — running the file *is* what their registered handler does. So are the
#: macro-bearing Office formats (``.docm``, ``.xlsm``) and the pointer files
#: (``.lnk``, ``.url``, ``.webloc``), which are an indirection to another program.
