"""What a tool *does* if it runs, in five classes.

Three markings live on the tools today and none of them answers this question.
``requires_approval=True`` says "pause before running this"; an ``ApprovalRequired`` raised
from inside a call says "pause, now that I have seen the arguments"; a tool carrying
neither says nothing at all. All three are about **when to ask the operator** — they
schedule a prompt. None of them describes the act itself, which is what a permission level
has to know *before* the model is offered the tool. "May this run in a read-only thread?"
has no answer in a marking whose only purpose is to raise a dialog.

So every tool carries a **sensitivity**: the worst thing it can do, named. The classes are
kinds of reach, not degrees of danger:

- ``read`` — observes and returns. Reaching the network to observe (a web search, a page
  fetch, an IMAP body) is still reading: nothing anywhere is different afterwards.
- ``workspace_write`` — changes state this installation owns. The run's own files, the
  conversation's plan, the operator's memory and skills, a local draft. Visible from
  inside Odysseus, inspectable, and undoable from here.
- ``host_exec`` — hands a command or a program to an interpreter, so the worst case is not
  bounded by the tool's own arguments. The sandbox container is a fence around the blast
  radius, not a reason to call running arbitrary code a file write.
- ``external_effect`` — reaches something outside: a mail server, a calendar server, a live
  page in the operator's own browser session, a third-party tool.
- ``secret`` — touches credential material. Reading a password hands the model something no
  later approval can take back, which is why it is its own class and not an external read.

**Why the names are written out.** ``tools/`` sits above ``services/`` in the dependency
order, so walking the live catalog from here would invert it — the same constraint
``services/modes.py`` works under. The literal is not left to rot:
``tests/test_tool_sensitivity.py`` pins it against the catalog a real run resolves, in both
directions, so a renamed tool fails a test rather than silently losing its class.

**Why an unclassified name is treated as an external effect.** The catalog is not closed:
``external_{slug}_{tool}`` names come from the operator's own MCP servers and connectors,
so they cannot appear in any literal here. An unknown tool reaches something this module
cannot bound, which is exactly what ``external_effect`` means — and it is the fail-closed
direction: an unclassified tool is withheld from a read-only thread rather than admitted
to one.
