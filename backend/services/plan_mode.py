"""Plan mode — the written plan, and the level transitions either side of it.

The Plan permission level has always enforced read-only by *withholding* every mutating
tool (``services/tool_policy.permission_disabled_tools``). What it lacked was an ending: a
Plan turn could work everything out and had nowhere to put it, and no way for the operator
to say yes. This is that ending.

**One service for the document and the level, on purpose.** Approving a plan is not two
independent facts — it records the operator's yes *and* raises the thread to a level that
can act on it — and a caller able to do one without the other is a caller that can raise a
thread's permissions with no approved plan behind it. Keeping them in one method means
there is no such caller.

**It holds ``ConversationStore`` so no tool has to.** Setting the level is a write to the
conversation row, and the agent's capability bag deliberately does not contain the
conversation store: a tool that could reach every thread the operator has is not a
capability anything here needs. This is the narrow seam instead — two level transitions,
both about the thread the run is already in.

**Seeding the task list is part of approving.** An approved plan's steps *are* the work, so
execution begins from a list that already says so. It goes through the same
``ConversationTasks`` the agent's own tools write through, so the panel cannot tell a seeded
list from a written one — which is right: by then it is simply the thread's task list.
