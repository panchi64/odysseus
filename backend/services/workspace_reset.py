"""Wiping a workspace whose database is gone but whose encryption key is not.

Deleting ``data/app.db`` does not reset anything: the thing that says a workspace
exists is ``data/keyfile.json`` — the Argon2 verifier and the wrapped DEK — and it
sits beside the database rather than inside it. An operator who clears the database
to start over is therefore still asked to unlock, with a key that now protects an
empty workspace.

This is the other half of that: remove the key **and everything sealed under it**, so
"start fresh" means what it says. It is deliberately a wipe of ``data_dir`` rather
than a list of the directories we happen to know about today — everything under there
is runtime state the app wrote for itself (uploads, the corpus and its index, sandbox
work and sealed archives, View snapshots, the browser profile), and a sealed directory
added next month must be caught by default instead of quietly surviving a reset and
outliving the only key that could read it.

Two entries are held back, and only two:

* **the live database file** (plus its ``-wal``/``-shm`` siblings) — SQLAlchemy holds
  it open, and it is empty anyway; that is the precondition for being here at all.
* **``searxng/``** — a running container's bind-mount source, not operator data.

Coding-mode worktrees live outside ``data_dir`` on purpose (see ``Settings``), so a
reset never reaches the operator's own checkouts.
