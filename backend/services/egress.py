"""The one network allowlist every agent workspace is fenced by.

Compute is not the thing worth restricting — installing a package, cloning a repository
and burning CPU are what the workspace is *for*, and a fence that makes them feel
dangerous only teaches the operator to turn it off. Exfiltration is. So there is exactly
one policy here, expressed as domains, and both fences read it: the container's proxy
sidecar and the OS-level confinement the code-mode shell and the host hatch run under.
Two lists would mean a hole in whichever one nobody remembered to widen.

A workspace's allowlist is the installation-wide set (``egress_allowed_domains``) plus
whatever the operator approved for that particular conversation. The per-conversation
half is a durable record — the operator read a domain and agreed to it — so it lives in
the database, keyed by the same workspace key the session manager uses. A stateless run
writes rows there too: telling a run id from a conversation id is not something this
module can do, and the alternative (a second in-memory path) would be a second set of
semantics for the sake of a handful of rows that no longer name anything once the run
ends.

The fences do not read the database. They read a file — ``allow.txt``, one domain per
line — inside a **directory** this module materialises per workspace, because that
directory is what gets bind-mounted. A single-file bind mount would pin the inode the
mount was made against, and rewriting the file atomically (the only safe way to rewrite
it while a proxy is reading it) replaces that inode, so the container would keep seeing
the allowlist as it stood when it started.
