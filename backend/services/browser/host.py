"""HostBrowser — the visible Chromium the agent drives and the operator shares.

The browse tools used to attach to web fetch's containerized headless Chromium, which
made the agent's browsing invisible: the operator could watch a screencast of it but
could not *touch* it. Yet the two things an operator most wants from an agent's browser
are exactly the ones that need hands — do this one step faster than describing it, and
log me in before you start. So this browser is a real window on the operator's own
machine, launched by Playwright with ``headless=False``, and the agent reaches the same
window over CDP. Web fetch keeps its container untouched; this is a second browser, and
the only one page JavaScript from an agent-driven page runs in.

**Launched lazily.** ``ensure()`` is called from the session manager's attach path, so no
window appears at boot and a thread that never browses never opens one.

**The SSRF boundary survives the move to the host.** The same stdlib-only proxy web
fetch's sidecar runs (``services/webfetch/proxy_script.py``) is spawned here as a plain
host subprocess on loopback, and Chromium is pointed at it with ``--proxy-server`` plus
``--proxy-bypass-list=<-loopback>`` — the bypass list is what closes the hole a host
browser would otherwise open, since without it the window could reach this very backend
and every other service on the operator's loopback. Fail-closed: no proxy, no browser.
The cost is real and deliberate — a loopback dev server is unreachable in this window.

**Chromium's own sandbox is the rest of the boundary**, and it is asked for explicitly at
launch rather than left to Playwright's default, which is off. With no container under
this browser, the renderer sandbox is all that separates a page the model chose from the
operator's account.

**``cdp_url`` is the liveness answer, not a stored string.** It is ``None`` unless the
browser handle is still connected *and* the proxy is still running, so an operator who
quits Chromium (or a proxy that died) turns every session attached to it into one the
manager's next sweep reaps, and the acquire after that launches a fresh window.

The driver, the proxy spawn and the endpoint discovery are injectable for one reason: a
test may assert what we launch Chromium with, and must never launch Chromium.
