"""The attention surface's substrate — an in-memory index + ring-buffered live stream,
backed by a lock-aware write-behind drainer for durability.

Mirrors two existing disciplines rather than inventing a third:

- **`runs/stream.py`'s live-fan-out discipline**, for the stream half: `_emit` is
  synchronous and `subscribe` registers-then-snapshots with no `await` between, so a
  subscriber can never observe a gap or a duplicate. Unlike a `RunStream` (buffered for
  one run's lifetime, then closed), this stream is process-lifetime and its buffer is a
  true ring — bounded, oldest evicted — since it isn't scoped to one short-lived run.
- **`services/conversations.py`'s memory-fast/DB-durable split**, for the record half:
  an in-memory index is the authoritative read path (what `list_notifications`,
  `mark_read`, etc. answer against, immediately and consistently), while a background
  `WriteBehindWorker` persists it off the critical path, encrypting the sealed fields
  only in the drainer (the lock-aware side of the queue) so a locked vault parks the
  write instead of losing it. Read/resolve mutations ride the **same** drainer queue as
  their creating insert, so an update can never race ahead of — and silently no-op
  against — a row that hasn't landed in the DB yet.

This module only records and streams what it's told. *Whether* to notify (the emit
policy: which run outcomes are noteworthy, whether anyone was already watching) lives
with the callers — the engine, the run registry, the approval routes — not here.

**Out-of-band delivery** (`AE-3.2`, `TASK-6`) rides on top: the in-app record is always
written, and any :mod:`services.notification_channels` channel handed in additionally
carries the interruption-worthy kinds to email/push. Delivery uses a second lock-aware
drainer, so a channel is never on the critical path of the thing that notified: an
unreachable mail server degrades the run to in-app-only rather than breaking its approval
park, and a locked vault parks the send (the sealed address can't be opened) rather than
losing it.
