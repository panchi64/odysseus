"""The embedding capability — turn text into vectors for semantic recall.

A thin async interface over the configured ``embedding``-role endpoint (resolved
from the model registry). It calls the provider's OpenAI-compatible
``/embeddings`` API directly, since embeddings are not a Pydantic AI chat model.

Pluggable by design (the :class:`Embedder` protocol): the real implementation
talks to a model server; tests inject a deterministic fake. **Graceful
degradation (`XC-DEG-1`):** when no embedding endpoint is configured the embedder
is *unavailable* and raises :class:`~core.exceptions.DegradedCapabilityError`,
which the memory store catches to fall back to keyword recall (`MEM-2`).
