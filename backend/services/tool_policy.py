"""The operator's tool-enablement policy (`AE-3.3`).

The enforcement point already exists: ``tools/toolsets.py``'s enabled gate drops a
disabled tool from the catalog the model is offered, so the agent can neither see nor
invoke it. This module is the **operator's half** — which tools they turned off, made
durable, and composed with the suspensions the system decides on its own.

Seven independent sources feed one set:

- **the operator's explicit choices**, persisted through ``settings_store`` under
  ``tools.disabled`` as a plain JSON list of namespaced tool names. Policy, not content,
  so it stays in the clear like every other app preference;
- **offline mode's automatic web-tool suspension** (``services/offline``), derived from
  connectivity rather than chosen;
- **the run's mode** — whether a tool belongs in this kind of thread, read off the mode
  registry (``services/modes.py``) rather than restated here;
- **the run's permission level** — under Plan, every tool that would change something is
  withheld outright, classified by ``services/tool_sensitivity.py``;
- **the model's own reach** — a tool that answers with an image is withheld from a model
  that cannot see one;
- **whether anyone is watching** — a tool that suspends the turn on the operator is
  withheld from a run that has no operator in front of it (``runs/lanes.py``);
- **whether the capability exists at all** — a category whose backing service the
  operator has never set up (no mailbox connected, no calendar, no secrets vault) is
  withheld rather than offered so that every call can fail.

They **union**: :func:`effective_disabled_tools` is the one place that rule lives, so no
run path can apply one source and silently drop the others. Every site that fills
``RunDeps.disabled_tools`` calls it — the live chat turn, the approval-resume path, and
the scheduler's unattended task executor.

**Mode is a filter, not a second catalog.** ``app.state.tool_categories`` is assembled
once at startup and ``tools/catalog.py`` derives the operator's settings list from it;
building a different mapping per mode would let the settings page and the agent's real
stack disagree, which is the exact failure the namespacing was built to prevent. So the
`shell` and `repo` categories are registered like every other, listed like every other,
and simply withheld from a run that is not in their mode. **Which** categories a mode
admits is the registry's answer, not this module's — mode is one axis of a thread, and
this module only knows how to turn an axis into a withheld set.
