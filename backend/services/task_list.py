"""The agent's task list, persisted per conversation and streamed as it changes.

``pydantic_ai_harness.Planning`` owns the tools and the model-facing behaviour; it depends
only on a six-method :class:`~pydantic_ai_harness.planning.PlanStore` protocol. This is our
implementation of it — sealed under the vault, keyed by conversation, and emitting a
``tasks.updated`` event on every mutation so the chat surface can render the list live.

**The harness's vocabulary is not ours.** Upstream calls an item a ``PlanItem`` and the
protocol a ``PlanStore``, because upstream has only one such concept. Here *plan* means the
written, approvable document a Plan-level turn produces (``services/plan_mode.py``), and
this is the running checklist underneath it — so the upstream names are imported under ours
and nothing below this line says "plan".

**Every mutation emits, including the bulk replace.** The harness's own stores leave
``set_items`` event-silent (it is a wholesale replacement), which would be a real hole
here: ``write`` is the tool a model reaches for first and most often, so a surface built on
events alone would sit empty through exactly the call that matters. Emitting from the store
rather than from a hook means every path — bulk or granular — reports uniformly.

**The event carries the whole list, not a delta.** The per-run stream is replayable from
any sequence number (``runs/``), so a full-state event is idempotent on replay and needs no
ordering rules; the list is a handful of short strings, and correctness here is worth more
than the bytes.

**A locked vault degrades to no tasks rather than an error.** The list is an aid to the
turn, not the turn itself: a run that cannot read it should carry on without one instead of
failing, which is why reads fall back to empty and writes are dropped.
