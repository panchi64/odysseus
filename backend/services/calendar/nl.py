"""Natural-language event entry (`CAL-3`) — "lunch Friday 1pm" becomes a draft.

The split here is the point: **the model reads the phrase, the code does the arithmetic.**
A utility-model call fills a small structured draft (title, a *local wall-clock* start,
optional end/location/rrule) and nothing else; converting that wall clock into a UTC
instant, defaulting a missing end, and validating the recurrence rule all happen
deterministically afterwards. Letting the model emit UTC — or a rule nobody parsed — is how
a calendar quietly acquires events an hour off, on the wrong day, or repeating forever.

The result is a **draft, not an event.** It is returned for the operator (or the agent's
own confirmation step) to accept; nothing is written here, so a misread phrase costs a
correction rather than a stray entry.

Like `services/webfetch/distill.py`, this builds a bare ``pydantic_ai.Agent`` over an
injected model resolver — a service must not import the engine layer.
