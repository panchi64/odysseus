"""Recurrence expansion — one stored rule, many occurrences, computed at read time.

A recurring event is a single row carrying an RFC 5545 ``RRULE`` (`models/calendar.py`).
Nothing is ever materialized: a caller asks "what falls inside this window" and this module
runs ``dateutil.rrule`` over the rule, filters the operator's ``EXDATE`` cancellations, and
returns UTC instants. That keeps an open-ended rule finite (the window bounds it), keeps an
edit to a series a single-row update, and keeps the DB free of thousands of rows nobody asked
for.

## Why the expansion runs in the event's own time zone

Expanding in UTC is the classic calendar bug: a daily 09:00 Madrid standup expanded as
"08:00 UTC + 24h" becomes 10:00 local the moment Spain moves to summer time. So a timed
event is expanded against a ``dtstart`` **localized to its own IANA zone**, and
``dateutil`` advances the *wall clock* (it re-attaches the same ``tzinfo`` to each generated
datetime), so 09:00 stays 09:00 and only the UTC instant shifts across the DST boundary.
Each occurrence is converted back to UTC exactly once, at the end.

An **all-day** event is the mirror image: it is a *date* range, so it is expanded in UTC and
never localized at all. Localizing it is what makes "the 9th" become the 8th at 23:00 for a
viewer one zone west — the shift `CAL-1` calls out. Its instants are UTC midnights and stay
that way, whoever reads them.

``UNTIL`` is normalized before the rule is parsed: ``dateutil`` refuses to mix a floating or
date-only ``UNTIL`` with an aware ``dtstart``, and both forms are legal in a file the
operator imported, so they are rewritten into the UTC form the parser accepts.
