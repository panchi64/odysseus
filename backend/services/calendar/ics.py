"""ICS import/export — the interchange format (`CAL-2`).

Standard calendar files are how a calendar leaves and enters the system: an operator
exports a calendar to hand it to something else, or imports the file another tool gave
them. Both directions run through ``icalendar``; nothing here talks to the DB, so the same
parser serves the ICS upload route *and* the CalDAV sync (a CalDAV object **is** an ICS
document — see `caldav.py`).

**Round-trip is lossless for the fields we model.** Everything the store keeps —
``uid``/``summary``/``description``/``location``, the span, the zone, all-day-ness, the
``RRULE``, and the ``EXDATE`` set — survives an export→import cycle unchanged. That falls
out of writing timed events with a ``TZID`` parameter (so the zone name comes back, not
just the instant) and all-day events as ``DATE`` values (so they stay dates and can't be
re-read as midnight-in-some-zone).

Properties we don't model — attendees, alarms, attachments, per-occurrence overrides
(``RECURRENCE-ID``) — are **dropped on import rather than half-kept**. A half-parsed
attendee list is worse than none: it would look authoritative on screen and be wrong.
