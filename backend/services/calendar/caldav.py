"""CalDAV sync — reconciling a local calendar with a remote collection (`CAL-2`).

A CalDAV object *is* an ICS document, so this module owns none of the parsing: it moves
bytes between the server and `ics.py`, and every merge decision is the same ``UID`` match
an ICS import already makes.

Three things shape the implementation:

- **The `caldav` package is synchronous.** Every call is a blocking HTTP round-trip, so the
  whole remote conversation runs inside ``anyio.to_thread`` — and in as few hops as
  possible (one thread for the pull, one for the push) rather than a hop per request.
- **The server URL is operator-supplied and therefore untrusted.** It is SSRF-checked
  (`core/ssrf`) before every sync, on the same principle as web fetch: a URL the system
  will connect to on someone's behalf is re-validated at use time, not trusted from when
  it was saved.
- **Credentials never leave the vault in the clear.** They are decrypted into locals for
  the duration of one sync and are never logged, never returned, and never written back.

**Scope.** Sync is *pull-authoritative with a first-time push*: remote changes win on
conflict (the server is the shared copy), local events that have never been pushed are
uploaded, and an event the server no longer has is removed locally — but only when the
remote listing came back whole, since a truncated one can't tell a deleted event from one
it never reached (`MAX_REMOTE_OBJECTS`). A local **deletion** is
not propagated — knowing a row was deleted rather than never created needs a tombstone the
schema doesn't carry, and inventing a heuristic here would silently delete the operator's
data off a server shared with other clients.
