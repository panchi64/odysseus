"""Reading an ``ask_user`` call, writing the operator's reply into it, and reading it back.

One module owns every half on purpose. The questions the client renders, the prose the
model reads and the structure the transcript redraws are derived from the *same* place —
the arguments of the parked call — so a label the operator clicked cannot mean one thing
on screen and another in history. The client sends back which options it chose, never the
prose; this is where prose is made, and it is made from the parked arguments rather than
from anything the client said.

**Why the arguments are parsed defensively.** They are whatever the model produced. A
badly-shaped ``questions`` list must degrade to a thin question rather than raise: the
first caller is the park, which is a turn in the middle of stopping cleanly, and an
exception there strands the run instead of pausing it.

**Why it lives in ``services/`` rather than beside the park that first needed it.** Two
readers are below the agent layer: the answer is rendered into the tool's result by the
approve route, and read back out of that result by ``services/conversation_view.py`` so a
reloaded transcript draws the same card the live stream drew. The alternative to one home
is two copies of a format that only works while they agree — the same reasoning that put
``services/subagents/report.py`` where it is.
