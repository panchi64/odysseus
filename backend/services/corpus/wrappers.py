"""Adapter wrappers — plug the existing rich stores into the corpus seam.

The whole point of ADAPTER-UNIFIED: ``MemoryStore`` and ``ConversationSearch`` already
do hybrid recall over their own encrypted tables, so they enroll into the corpus
**untouched, zero migration** — a thin wrapper translates their hit shape to
:class:`CorpusHit` and their counts to :class:`SourceStatus`. They embed on their own
write path, so ``reindex`` delegates to their existing re-embed (memory) or is a no-op
(the conversation index re-embeds via its own coordinator).

There was a stub adapter here too — a placeholder that listed a planned surface with no
content, so the ``/rag`` list could show the whole picture before every extraction
pipeline existed. Its last holder was deep research, which is now a *conversation* and so
is already covered by the conversation adapter above; a placeholder with nothing left to
hold is just a source the operator can never index, so it went with it.
