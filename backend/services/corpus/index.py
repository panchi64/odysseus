"""``CorpusIndex`` — the one retrieval capability across every knowledge source.

This is the service the plan collapses two hand-rolled hybrid recalls into. It holds a
registry of :class:`SourceAdapter`, and ``retrieve`` fans a query out to the selected
adapters and **RRF-fuses** their per-source hits into one ranking. RRF is rank-based, so
scores from different stores (memory's fused score, a folder chunk's cosine) fuse cleanly
without normalization — a hit's globally-unique ``gid`` keys the fusion so two sources'
refs never collide.

It also owns the ``/rag`` surface's reads: ``list_sources`` (flatten every adapter's
status), ``stats`` (embedding model/dims from the registry + totals), and the folder
lifecycle (``add_folder``/``remove_folder``/``reindex``/``rebuild``) delegated to the
one :class:`FolderAdapter`.
