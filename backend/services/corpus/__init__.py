"""The knowledge corpus — one retrieval index over many pluggable sources.

``CorpusIndex`` is the capability: it fans a query out to registered
:class:`SourceAdapter` instances and RRF-fuses their hits into one ranking, and it
owns the ``/rag`` surface reads (source list, stats, folder lifecycle). The existing
rich stores (memory, conversations) enroll as wrapper adapters untouched; chunked
content (folders now, more later) lands in the generic ``corpus_chunk`` store via
:class:`CorpusChunkStore`. See ``services/CLAUDE.md``.
