"""The uploads source — index extracted upload text into the corpus.

The in-app counterpart to :class:`~services.corpus.documents.DocumentsAdapter`: where
that indexes document bodies, this indexes the **text extracted from uploaded files**
(the `UP-2` output) so the agent retrieves an upload's contents through the one
``corpus.retrieve`` tool. Only the extracted text is indexed — never the raw bytes —
and it's chunked and sealed into the shared ``corpus_chunk`` store exactly as documents
and folders are.

Each upload is its own ``source_id`` (the upload id) under the shared
``source_kind="uploads"``, so re-indexing a single upload (after the operator corrects
its extracted text) touches only that upload's chunks. Indexing runs on the same
lock-aware :class:`~core.worker.WriteBehindWorker` the documents source uses, and like
that source an index job **clears the upload's existing chunks before inserting** — a
correction that shortens the text must not strand orphan chunks.
