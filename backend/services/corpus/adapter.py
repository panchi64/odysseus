"""The ``SourceAdapter`` seam — one knowledge source plugged into the corpus.

The corpus is a single retrieval index fed by many sources. Rather than force every
source into one table, each source is an **adapter**: it knows how to retrieve from
*its* store (a folder's chunk rows, the memory store, the conversation index) and how
to report *its* status to the ``/rag`` source list. Each adapter returns its hits
**already ranked** (best first); ``CorpusIndex`` fuses those per-source lists by rank
(Reciprocal Rank Fusion).

A hit's ``gid`` is globally unique across sources (``"{source_id}:{ref}"``) so the
fusion never collides two sources' refs. Fusion is purely **rank-based**, so a
source's own scores (a memory's fused score, a folder chunk's cosine) never have to
share a scale — only their ordering matters.
