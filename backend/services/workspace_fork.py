"""Landing a delegated agent's forked workspace, and reporting what came back.

A sub-agent that works apart never edits the workspace that launched it. It gets its own
copy — a sandbox session cloned from the parent's, or its own checkout on its own branch —
and what it changed is merged back afterwards, with any conflict *reported* rather than
resolved in its favour.

**Taking the copy is not here**, and that is the shape rather than an omission. A
delegated run resolves its workspace the way every run does — repeatedly, from its own
workspace key, through ``services/workspace.py`` — so the fork is cut on its first
file-tool call by whichever manager owns that kind. What has no other home is the *other*
end: landing the copy happens when the child's run reaches terminal, from a hook with no
``RunContext``, no deps and no workspace left to resolve. So the parameters here are spelled
out rather than read off ``RunDeps``: ``services`` sits below ``tools`` in the dependency
order and must not import it.

Every handle is resolved optionally, which is the same degrade every capability-backed
feature makes: a host with no container runtime can still run a sub-agent, it just cannot
give one a workspace of its own, and the caller turns that into a sentence rather than an
exception.
