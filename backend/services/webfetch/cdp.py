"""Finding a Chromium's DevTools endpoint — shared by both browsers this app runs.

Two very different browsers need the same three lines: the containerized headless one web
fetch renders pages in, and the visible one on the host the agent drives. Both are reached
by asking ``/json/version`` for its websocket URL and then **rewriting the authority**,
because the endpoint a browser reports is the one it sees itself on — a container's own
internal port, or a hostname that resolves to nothing out here. The port we can actually
reach it on is the one we published or asked for, so that is the one that goes in the URL.

Polling rather than a single read: a port accepts connections before Chromium has finished
bringing DevTools up, so the first few reads legitimately fail and only the deadline is a
real answer.
