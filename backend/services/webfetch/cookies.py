"""In-memory, per-domain cookie jar — lets a solved JS/bot challenge carry forward.

Each fetch otherwise gets a fresh context with no cookies (deliberate isolation), so a
site that gates content behind a JS challenge (Reddit's ``js_challenge``, Cloudflare's
``cf_clearance``) re-issues and re-solves it on *every* fetch — slow, and repeated
challenges from one IP read as bot-like. This caches the cookies a context accumulates and
re-seeds the ones whose domain matches the next fetch's URL, so the clearance token
persists across fetches to the same site.

Deliberately **in-memory only** (never written to disk, never sealed — there is nothing to
leak at rest) and **bounded** (a TTL plus a hard cap on entries, oldest evicted first). It
relaxes the no-shared-cookies isolation only within a single process lifetime — the
tradeoff for not re-solving every challenge. Matching uses each cookie's own ``domain``
attribute (the site set it), so no public-suffix list is needed.
