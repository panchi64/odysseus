"""Rendered DOM → Markdown extraction.

The fetcher renders a page in a headless browser and hands the fully-rendered HTML
here. **trafilatura** is the primary extractor — the top-scoring open-source main-content
extractor — run over the HTML string (independent of its own downloader) and emitting
Markdown natively, preserving tables/links/code. It is itself a cascade (its own
heuristics → readability-lxml → jusText). When it returns nothing usable we fall back to
the page's rendered ``innerText`` — a genuinely different failure mode that covers
non-prose pages (search results, forums, listings) and guarantees non-empty output when
visible text exists.

The extractor list is a **seam**: add a tier (a dedicated HTML→Markdown converter, or a
scored ensemble) by appending to :data:`EXTRACTORS` — the cascade and the innerText
fallback stay the same.
