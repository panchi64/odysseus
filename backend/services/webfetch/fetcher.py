"""BrowserFetcher — fetch one URL by rendering it in a headless browser, then extract
its main content as Markdown.

Replaces the old static httpx+trafilatura fetch: the page is loaded in Chromium so its
JavaScript runs and client-rendered content is present, then the rendered DOM is handed
to the extractor (:mod:`services.webfetch.extract`). The entry URL is pre-flighted
(:func:`core.ssrf.assert_public_url`) before a context opens, and every request the browser
then makes is gated by the proxy sidecar (:mod:`services.webfetch.proxy_script`). Output is
untrusted-wrapped — web content is data, never instructions.

Domain errors only (so the service stays reusable by non-agent callers): ``SSRFError`` for
a target refused by the pre-flight (hard boundary), ``WebFetchError`` for an
unreadable/unreachable page or a request the proxy refused mid-navigation (recoverable). The
tool layer maps these to a refusal message vs ``ModelRetry``.
