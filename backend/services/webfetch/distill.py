"""Goal-aware distillation of an oversized fetched page.

When a page's body exceeds the fetch output cap, blind truncation keeps only the head — but
the model usually knows what it's looking for. Given a ``goal``, :class:`WebDistiller` walks
the page in windows and asks the utility model to keep only the goal-relevant passages
(verbatim figures/tables preserved), so the capped result is the *relevant* part of a long
page rather than its first N characters. Truncation + offset paging remains the fallback:
any timeout, model error, or all-empty result returns ``None`` and the caller truncates.

The distiller builds a bare ``pydantic_ai.Agent`` directly — services must not import the
engine layer — over a model resolved by an injected callable (a closure over the registry's
background-model rule, wired in ``app.py``). Its output is still web-derived, so the caller
wraps it untrusted exactly like raw content.
