"""Per-domain politeness — space out requests to one site.

A burst of fetches at one host trips its rate limiter (the "whoa there, slow down" class of
block, distinct from fingerprinting), and hammering a site in parallel reads as bot-like.
This serializes same-host fetches with a minimum gap between them, while letting different
hosts run concurrently (bounded separately by the browser's semaphore). Keyed by hostname —
no public-suffix list, and subdomains throttle independently, which is the safe default.

In-memory and per-process, like the cookie jar. ``min_interval_s <= 0`` makes ``slot`` a
no-op, so the feature is a single config flip.
