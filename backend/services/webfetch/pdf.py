"""Fetch a PDF a page navigation refused to render and pull its text layer.

The headless browser can't *render* a PDF — a `.pdf` URL makes Chromium start a download,
which surfaces as a "Download is starting" navigation error. Rather than burn the fetch
tool's retry budget on an unreadable page, :func:`fetch_pdf_text` downloads the bytes
directly (SSRF-guarded on every redirect hop, size-capped) and extracts their text with the
same ``pypdfium2`` scanner the upload pipeline uses. There is no vision OCR here — a scanned
PDF with no text layer comes back as a recoverable ``WebFetchError`` telling the model to try
another source.

Domain errors only (``WebFetchError``/``SSRFError``), like the rest of ``webfetch`` — the
tool layer maps them to a retry vs a refusal.
