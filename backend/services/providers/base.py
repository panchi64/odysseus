"""The provider contract — what one model-API family knows how to do.

A *provider* is the adapter between an operator's endpoint row and a concrete
Pydantic AI model class: it builds the model, lists/probes the remote catalog,
declares whether a key is required, ships the preset the frontend prefills a new
endpoint from, and knows how to turn reasoning off for its own models. Everything
above (the registry's role resolution, fallback chains, encryption) is
provider-agnostic; everything provider-specific lives in one adapter module.

Adapters register by presence: a module in this package exposing ``PROVIDER``
is discovered by the pkgutil walk in ``__init__`` — the same contract as the
feature manifests. Adding a lab is one file.

        **Every adapter puts ``spec.context_window`` on the model's profile**, and this
        is the one place the reason is written down. Pydantic AI resolves a profile's
        ``context_window`` from its own price data when no layer states one — which
        answers a question about a *model name*, not about a *server*, and those differ
        exactly where this product lives. A llama.cpp instance started with ``-c 8192``
        advertises its architecture's 128k ceiling, and any endpoint named after a
        well-known model inherits that model's number no matter what is behind the base
        URL. The window that matters is the one the server will accept.

        ``spec.context_window`` is the answer to the right question: the registry funnels
        every resolution through ``_with_model_limits``, which prefers the operator's
        own figure and otherwise probes the server. **When it is set, it wins** — in
        every adapter.

        Where the adapters differ is what to do when it is ``None``, and the split is
        not arbitrary: it is whether this adapter's base URL identifies the vendor.
        ``anthropic`` and ``google`` talk to one lab's API, so the model name really does
        name that model and the library's figure is the best available — it is left
        alone. ``openai-compatible`` fronts *any* server, so a recognised name is a
        coincidence of what the operator typed and the guess is actively wrong; there the
        profile is pinned to ``None``. Unknown is the honest state and the one the rest of
        the codebase already handles: an endpoint that declares no window never folds,
        because folding on a guess compacts a thread that was never under pressure.

        on the model's standing settings, where a request's own ``max_tokens`` still
        wins. The OpenAI and Gemini wires treat an absent value as the server's own

        shape that is true whoever is calling — so the adapter hands them to the model
        **at construction** (``Model(settings=…)``) rather than to any one call site.
        That placement is the whole point: a setting applied there survives a fallback
        chain, a parked turn resumed hours later, and every path that builds its own
