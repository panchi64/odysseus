        """Prompt-cache retention, and nothing else — usually not even that.

        OpenAI caches a matching prefix **implicitly**, with no request field: there is one
        breakpoint, it needs at least a thousand-odd tokens, and the whole rendered prefix
        (tools included) has to match byte for byte. So the work that makes caching pay on
        this wire is *prefix stability*, which is structural and lives nowhere near here. The
        only thing a request field can add is holding that prefix longer than the default
        five to ten minutes, which is what `openai_cache_retention` asks for.

        Nothing here reads ``descriptor``, and that is the load-bearing part. This adapter
        fronts **every** OpenAI-shaped server — llama.cpp, vLLM, LM Studio, MLX, a hosted
        gateway, a non-US lab — and the only thing it knows about what is behind the base URL
        is the model *name* the operator typed. So:

        - **``openai_prompt_cache_key`` is never sent.** It selects a cache shard; it does not
          decide whether a prefix is cached. Worth nothing on every local engine, and there is
          no conversation visible at this seam to key on anyway.
        - **``openai_prompt_cache_options`` (and ``CachePoint``) are never sent.** They are
          meaningful on two hosted families, recognisable here only by name — and a local
          model an operator happened to name after one of them would be handed breakpoints it
          cannot parse. That inference is exactly the bug this adapter's boundary exists to
          prevent. If explicit breakpoints ever matter, the answer is a distinct native
          adapter, not a name match.

        Default off: the within-session case is already covered by OpenAI's own retention, so
        the field earns its keep only for a thread an operator comes back to tomorrow.
