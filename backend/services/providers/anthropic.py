"""Anthropic — native adapter over Pydantic AI's ``AnthropicModel``.

Speaks the Messages API directly (system prompts, tool use, and thinking blocks in
their native shape) instead of squeezing Claude through an OpenAI-compat gateway.
``base_url`` is honored, so an Anthropic-compatible proxy still works.

        the tool catalog — about fourteen thousand tokens of schema before the first word
        of the thread. Without a breakpoint every turn pays full price to re-read them.

        The three settings are the three prefixes, and they compose: ``anthropic_cache``
        is the automatic breakpoint that walks forward as the conversation grows,
        ``anthropic_cache_instructions`` pins the system block and
        ``anthropic_cache_tool_definitions`` pins the tool array. Only
        ``anthropic_cache_messages`` conflicts with the automatic one, and it is
        deliberately absent — it is the fallback for gateways that reject the top-level
        parameter, not a fourth breakpoint.
