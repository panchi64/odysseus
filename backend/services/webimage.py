"""Fetch a remote image on the operator's behalf, so their browser never does.

An answer can hyperlink the web (see ``prompts.agent``), and an image is the natural
next step — a chart on the page the model just read is worth showing, not describing.
But ``<img src="https://…">`` is not like a link: it fetches **on render**, with no
click to gate it. Pointed at a host chosen by relayed, untrusted page content, that is
a silent request carrying the operator's IP, user-agent, and any cookies for that
host — the classic markdown-image exfiltration channel.

So the browser never sees the remote URL. It asks *us* (``routes.media``), and this
service does the fetching, one origin removed from the operator:

* :func:`core.ssrf.assert_public_url` on the URL and again on every redirect hop, so
  the proxy can't be aimed at loopback, the LAN, or a cloud metadata endpoint.
* The response has to actually be a raster image — declared content type **and**
  magic bytes must agree on a format in :data:`IMAGE_TYPES`. A server that answers an
  ``<img>`` with HTML is not serving an image, and we don't pass it on.
* A byte cap enforced *while streaming*, so a hostile or mistaken URL can't stream
  gigabytes through the backend before anyone notices the declared length was a lie.

What this deliberately does not solve: the remote host still learns its URL was
requested, so a URL that encodes exfiltrated data still arrives — from this machine's
address, at a time correlated with the answer. Closing that needs a human click before
the fetch, which is a product decision, not a service one. The agent's own
``web_fetch`` can already reach an arbitrary URL; what this removes is the operator's
identity and the silence.
