"""Disabling model "thinking" across providers — the one place that knows how.

**Prefer Pydantic AI's own lever.** Its :class:`~pydantic_ai.settings.ModelSettings`
has a unified, provider-agnostic ``thinking`` field (``False`` to disable, or an
effort level), and each model class translates it to that provider's request shape
— OpenAI's ``reasoning_effort``, Anthropic's thinking budget, and so on. That is
the engine doing its job; we should ride it, not re-derive ``reasoning_effort``
ourselves.

But ``thinking`` is only safe to send to a model that actually reasons (sent to a
plain chat model it can become an unsupported ``reasoning_effort`` argument), and
it does **not** cover every lever — notably Qwen-family models served over
OpenAI-compatible runtimes (vLLM/SGLang/llama.cpp) gate the ``<think>`` block on a
``chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking`` request field the library doesn't model.

So this module is a thin **strategy** layer that decides, per model family, *which*
settings actually turn reasoning off — preferring the unified ``thinking`` field
and dropping to a provider-specific lever only for the gaps. Each strategy
recognizes a family from a :class:`ModelDescriptor`; :func:`disable_thinking`
returns the first match, or **empty settings** ("let it think") for an unrecognized
model — a safe default that never sends an argument the model would reject.

Adding support for a new model family is adding a strategy:

    from services import reasoning

    def _my_lab(d: reasoning.ModelDescriptor) -> reasoning.ModelSettings | None:
        if d.model_id.startswith("mylab-"):
            # Prefer the unified field when the provider's model class maps it…
            return {"thinking": False}
            # …or a provider lever only for what `thinking` can't express:
            # return {"extra_body": {"disable_reasoning": True}}
        return None

    reasoning.register_strategy(_my_lab)

Match **narrowly** — return ``None`` unless you are sure the descriptor is your
family — so an unrecognized model is left alone rather than handed a field it will
400 on.
