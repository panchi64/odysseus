"""Sub-agents a project declares for itself, in its own files.

A repository that has written down how *its* reviewer should work knows something this
installation cannot, and the convention for writing it down already exists: a markdown
file with YAML frontmatter under ``.claude/agents/`` — the shape Claude Code reads, and
the one the repo-inventory tool already reports to the model. So a project definition is
not a second kind of sub-agent. It is a :class:`SubagentSpec` built from a file instead of
from :mod:`services.subagents.roster`, and past this module nothing can tell the two apart.

**Where the files are found is not decided here.** The harness's own asset scan
(``.claude``, ``.agents``, ``.codex``, ``.grok``, each with an ``agents/`` directory) is
what the inventory tool reports, and reusing it is what keeps "where your agent files are"
and "which agent files were loaded" from ever disagreeing. Files sitting directly in
``.agents/`` are picked up as well, because a directory named that is an agents directory
whatever the scan's shape suggests.

**A bad file is skipped, never fatal.** These are hand-written, they arrive with a
checkout, and nobody editing one is watching this process. A file that cannot be read
costs its own sub-agent and nothing else — the roster is still the built-ins plus whatever
parsed, and what went wrong is logged rather than raised into a turn the operator was in
the middle of.

**A declaration is a request, never a grant.** ``permission`` here is folded against the
launching thread's own level at launch, so a file asking for the run of the place gets
exactly what the operator already allowed. That is enforced in the launcher rather than
trusted here — this module's job is to read the file honestly, including honestly
reporting what it asks for.
