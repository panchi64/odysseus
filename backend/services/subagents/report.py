"""How a message crossing the link between a thread and its sub-agent is framed.

Two messages cross it, in opposite directions: a **report** coming back when a sub-agent
finishes, and a **direction** going down when the launching agent redirects one that is
still working. Both are framed here, on one shape, because they have the same problem.

Pydantic AI has one shape for a message from outside the model — ``UserPromptPart`` — so a
report rides into the launching thread as one. Left bare it would claim the operator typed
it: the model would answer as though they had, the transcript would show it as theirs, and
every later turn would replay it that way. A direction has the mirror of that problem —
a sub-agent has no operator at all, so unframed text in its thread is from nobody. So both
are wrapped, once, here.

**One envelope, both roads.** A report reaches the thread two ways — queued into a turn
that is still running, or as the prompt of a turn it wakes — and the wording is identical,
because those are the same event and nothing downstream should be able to tell which route
it took.

**Two readers, one constant.** To the model the envelope is plain framing and nothing
parses it. Coming back out, the transcript recognises it and renders a report rather than
something the operator said. That reader matches the **whole** header this module writes —
opener *and* preamble — rather than the opening tag alone, because an operator can type
angle brackets and a message of theirs relabelled as a sub-agent's is the same lie in
reverse.

**It is a label, not a credential**, and nothing may come to depend on it as one: a text
marker is forgeable by anyone who can type it, and what a forgery buys is a differently
styled bubble in the forger's own thread. The load-bearing answer to "who sent this" is
``QueuedMessage.source``, which is structural and never arrives from outside.

It lives in ``services/`` rather than beside the injection point because both of those
readers are below the agent layer, and the alternative to one home is two copies of a
marker that only works while they agree.

**A report also has a structured half**, appended inside the same envelope and defined in
the second section of this module: findings, conflicts and per-topic coverage as data, so
a fan-out of researchers can be read as a coverage map rather than as N essays. Same
reasoning for the same home — the writer, the parser and the brief that asks for it only
work while they agree on one format.

# --- The report's structured half --------------------------------------------------
#
# A report was prose and nothing else, which is fine for the *model* reading it — prose is
# what a model is for — and useless for everything else. The operator asks three questions
# of a fan-out of researchers that prose cannot answer without being read end to end: what
# was actually established, where the sources disagree, and which corners of the question
# nobody covered. Those are the same three questions for every research thread, which is
# what makes them a shape rather than a summary.
#
# **Beside the prose, never instead of it.** The block is appended inside the same
# envelope, so the launching model reads the report exactly as it did before and a
# sub-agent that emits no block — or a malformed one — costs a panel, not a report. That
# degrade is the whole reason this parses leniently and logs rather than raising: a
# report is the only thing that survives a sub-agent, and losing one to a stray comma
# would be the worst possible trade.
#
# **It is a shape, not attribution.** A finding names the sources it rests on; it does not
# link a sentence of the launching agent's eventual answer to a sentence of a source.
# Claim-level attribution is an open design question with real trade-offs, and nothing
# here should be read as having pre-empted it.

#: Bounds the JSON block inside the report. Its own markers rather than a ``` fence: a
#: research report quotes code and quotes markdown, and a delimiter a source can contain is
#: a delimiter that eventually cuts the report in the wrong place.
