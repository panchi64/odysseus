"""What every sub-agent is told, on top of whatever its own spec says.

Three facts a sub-agent cannot work correctly without, and none of them belongs in a
spec: they are true of *being* a sub-agent, so a roster entry that had to restate them
would be a roster entry that could get them wrong. They are delivered as instructions
rather than as the opening message — rebuilt each turn, never read back out of history —
so nothing a sub-agent later reads can rewrite the terms it is working under.

The workspace note is the one that varies, and it varies per *launch* rather than per
sub-agent: the same worker shares the launching thread's files when the thread is waiting
on it and works in a fork when the thread means to carry on meanwhile. So it is resolved
where that is known, and the alternative — a brief that claims a private copy while the
sub-agent is in fact editing the operator's own tree — is the exact failure this avoids.
