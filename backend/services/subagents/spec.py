"""What a sub-agent *is*, as data.

A sub-agent is not a class and not a run loop. It is a handful of values that decide how
one ordinary turn is composed — which mode it runs in, how far it may reach, what standing
brief it is given, whether it gets a copy of the workspace. Everything else about it is the
engine every other turn uses.

Keeping it data is what makes the roster extensible without new code: a built-in sub-agent
and one a project declares in a file are the same record, built two ways, and the launcher
cannot tell them apart. A sub-agent that needed *behaviour* of its own would be a sign the
engine was missing something, not a reason for a subclass here.

**A spec is a request, never a grant.** Every field below is read as a ceiling the launcher
then lowers against the thread that asked — most importantly ``permission_ceiling``, which
is folded with the parent's own level so a sub-agent can never reach further than the
conversation that launched it. A project file declaring itself all-powerful gets exactly
what the operator already allowed and no more.

#: Which files a sub-agent works on. All three are one workspace *key* and nothing else —
#: see ``services/workspace.py`` for how a key is read.
#:
#: ``shared`` — the launching thread's own workspace. The default, and the one that makes a
#: sub-agent feel like part of the same session: it sees the work in progress, and what it
#: does is simply there afterwards, with nothing to merge. The cost is that two agents are
#: editing one tree, which is fine for reading and fine for work the parent is waiting on,
#: and wrong for anything long-running the parent means to keep working alongside.
#:
#: ``isolated`` — a delegated fork of that workspace: its own sandbox session, or its own
#: checkout on its own branch, cut from what the parent's transcript describes. What it
#: changed is merged back when it ends, and anything the parent changed meanwhile comes
#: back as a reported conflict rather than as the sub-agent's version winning.
#:
#: ``own`` — its own conversation's workspace, unrelated to the parent's. For a sub-agent
#: whose work is not about the parent's files at all (reading the open web, say).

    #: The sub-agent's standing brief, delivered as an instruction rather than as its
    #: opening message: instructions are rebuilt each turn and never read back out of
    #: history, so nothing the sub-agent later reads can rewrite what it was told to do.
    brief: str
    #: The mode it runs in. None inherits the parent's, which is usually right — a

    #: genuinely belongs elsewhere (research, which needs the open web).
