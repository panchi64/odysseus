"""The seam that lets the *agent* launch a sub-agent.

Same structural constraint that created the research seam, and the same answer: composing
a chat turn happens *above* ``tools/`` in the dependency order, so a tool cannot import it.
What a tool can do is resolve a capability by type out of the run's bag, and this is the
type it resolves — declared down here in ``services/``, implemented at the wiring layer
(``harness/manifests/_subagents.py``), and registered under this abstract type so the
concrete implementation is never named below its own layer.

**A sub-agent is an ordinary conversation.** It is composed by the same ``compose_turn``
an operator's own message goes through, runs the same engine, persists the same message
rows, and is measured by the same context gauge. What makes it a sub-agent rather than a
thread is three things: it is hidden from the session list, nobody can type into it, and
when it finishes its report is delivered back to the thread that launched it. None of that
is a second engine, and the moment it starts to become one, something here is wrong.

The interface is three verbs. ``launch`` returns the instant the child's first turn is
submitted — it never waits, because waiting is the whole thing this replaced. ``read`` is
how a parent checks on one it is still expecting. ``live`` is how the cap is counted and
how the panel backfills.

        rather than by the caller — which is why the handle to use is the one on the

        back to the spec's own name, the same thing every row that predates handles was

        ``isolate`` asks for the sub-agent to work in its *own* copy of the workspace,
