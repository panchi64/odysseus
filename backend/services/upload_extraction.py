"""Extract a usable text layer from an uploaded file — the `UP-2` pipeline.

Extraction is a **seam** (:class:`UploadExtractor`), so the heavy, high-fidelity path
and the light built-in one are interchangeable and composable:

- :class:`BasicExtractor` — the zero-setup built-in. PDFs are opened with ``pypdfium2``
  (a pure-wheel PDFium binding — no system packages, so it stays platform-agnostic,
  `XC-PORT`); each page's embedded text is pulled directly, and a page with little or
  no embedded text is image-only/scanned, so it is rasterized and handed to a **vision
  model** for OCR. Native text and OCR text occupy the same slot, so a mixed PDF comes
  out whole and in order. Plain-text files pass through decoded; anything else yields
  empty text. The vision call lives a layer up (``agent/vision.py``) so this capability
  never imports the engine — it depends only on the small :class:`VisionOCR` seam,
  which the agent layer implements and ``app.py`` injects.
- :class:`~services.upload_mineru.MinerUExtractor` — the high-fidelity path (layout,
  tables, formulas → clean Markdown), used when the operator has the ``mineru`` tool on
  the host. It is detected, not bundled (the same posture as the container runtime and
  SearXNG), so the project venv never pulls its PyTorch stack.
- :class:`FallbackExtractor` — composes the two: try the primary (MinerU), drop to the
  built-in on any failure, so a missing or broken high-fidelity path degrades to a
  working extraction rather than an error.

Every bound or degradation is reported in the result's ``note`` rather than silently
dropping content — a scanned PDF with no vision model configured comes back empty *with
a reason*, which the store turns into an actionable error the operator can retry. CPU
work (parsing, rasterizing) runs in a worker thread so it never blocks the event loop.
