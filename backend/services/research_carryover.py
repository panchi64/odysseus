"""Turning the retired research rows into the threads they should always have been.

Research was an entity: a question, a frozen plan and a finished report on a row of its
own, read back through its own REST surface. It is a conversation in research mode now,
and the operator's existing rows are not scaffolding to be discarded — a report is often
hours of reading they asked for and paid for.

The migration that retired the table could not do this itself. A message's projection and
its serialized blob are both sealed with the vault, and schema upgrades run at startup
*before* unlock, with no key — the same constraint ``app._backfill_sealed_columns`` works
under. So the migration copies the rows into a holding table and this drains it at the
first unlocked boot, where there is a key and where the conversation store's own row shapes
are in reach.

**One transaction per row, and the pen row is deleted inside it.** A half-written thread
would be worse than an unseeded one, and a crash mid-drain must leave every row either
carried over exactly once or still waiting. That also makes the whole thing resumable and
idempotent for free: a row that became a thread is gone from the pen, and a pen that is
empty is dropped, so the second boot does nothing and the third finds no table at all.
