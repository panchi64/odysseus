"""A delegated agent's own checkout: cut from its parent's branch, merged back on ask.

A child worktree is a **fork of its parent**, not of the project. It branches from the
parent conversation's branch and is created out of the parent's *working tree state* —
the parent snapshots first, so the child opens on the files the parent's transcript
describes rather than on whatever was last committed. Anything else hands a delegated
agent a tree that contradicts the instructions it was given.

It sits beside the parent's checkout rather than inside it, and it is warm: the
parent's ``.venv`` and ``node_modules`` are cloned across (copy-on-write where the
filesystem allows), because a child that reinstalls them before it can run a test is a
child nobody delegates to.

**Merging back writes the parent's worktree, never the operator's tree.** That is the
whole point of the fence: the operator's own files are still only ever written by the
merge they press themselves. A conflict is reported, never resolved and never forced —
the merge aborts and touches neither tree, and what becomes of the child afterwards is
its caller's to decide (the delegation that asked for the fork throws it away).
