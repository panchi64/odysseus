"""The files a code thread can name — what the composer's `@` picker browses.

**Operator-facing only, and agent-unreachable by construction.** The agent already reaches
this filesystem through ``files_list_directory`` and ``files_search_files``, rooted at the
workspace its run resolved; nothing under ``tools/`` or ``agent/`` may import this module,
and ``tests/test_host_surface_guard.py`` fails if anything does. What lives here is the
*other* direction — the operator picking a path to hand to the agent — which is a listing
of their own checkout and has no business being reachable from inside a turn.

**Git first, a bounded walk second.** ``git ls-files --cached --others
--exclude-standard`` answers in one call with tracked plus untracked-not-ignored files,
which means ``.gitignore`` is honoured for free and ``node_modules`` is never walked at
all. That last part is not an optimisation: a naive walk of a working repository spends
most of its time inside directories the operator would never reference. The fallback
exists for a directory that is not a repository yet — ``Project.git_initialized`` records
which — and is bounded in both depth and entries, because a picker that hangs is worse
than one that says it truncated.

**Ranking is here, not in the client.** Basename-prefix, then basename-substring, then
path-substring, in exclusive buckets — the same shape ``rankCommands`` and
``searchSettings`` keep. A path is mostly directory names, so a query matched anywhere in
one would bury the file actually called that under every file beneath a directory that
merely mentions it.

    **Not the holder map.** ``WorktreeManager._holders`` is an in-memory dict written only
    by ``acquire``, so after a backend restart a worktree that is still very much on disk
    has no holder — and a picker keyed on one would quietly fall back to the operator's own
    checkout while the agent's first file call re-acquires the worktree. The operator would
    pick ``src/foo.ts`` from a tree the agent cannot see, and nothing would report it.

    So the question is asked of the filesystem, which is where the answer actually lives:
    the worktree directory exists, and the branch checked out in it is this conversation's.
    Both halves matter — one worktree serves a project, so an existing directory on
    *another* thread's branch is not this thread's files.

    ``@`` would take the project's single worktree away from whatever else holds it. Before
