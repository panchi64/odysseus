"""Git worktrees — where coding mode actually works.

The operator's checkout is never written to. A coding conversation gets a **branch**
(``ody/<conversation-id>``) checked out in a worktree beside the repository, the agent
edits and runs tests there, and the only thing that ever touches the operator's own tree
is an explicit merge they ask for.

**The chassis commits, because nothing else does.** The agent edits with its file and
shell tools and has no `git commit` — deliberately: when a body of work becomes a commit
is not a judgement to hand the model. So `snapshot` stages and commits the worktree onto
the conversation's branch, and `diff`/`merge` call it before they read. Skip that and
every downstream step is inert *while looking correct*: a ref-to-ref diff reports nothing
after a session that rewrote ten files, MERGE lands nothing, and the delete gate never
fires. The history is one commit per review rather than one per turn — coarse, but honest
about what it is.

Four more decisions here are load-bearing and none of them is obvious from the code.

**One worktree per project, not per conversation.** A worktree is a full checkout, so
per-conversation would mean a fresh ``node_modules`` / ``.venv`` / build cache for every
thread — minutes of reinstall before the agent does anything useful, and no reap policy
short of deleting the thread. Sharing one per project keeps those caches warm, which is
most of the reason to code on the host at all. The cost is that only one coding
conversation can hold a project at a time; that is enforced rather than allowed to
silently interleave two threads over one checkout. A *delegated child* of the holding
conversation is the one exception — it gets its own checkout beside the parent's, still
owned by the same conversation (see :mod:`services.projects.fork`).

**Worktrees live outside ``data_dir``.** An approved host command is fenced by
``services/sandbox/host.py``, which denies reads of the whole data directory — the vault,
the sealed workspaces and the database are in there. A worktree beneath it would be
unreadable by the very shell that has to build and test it. The consequence is that a
worktree is plaintext on disk; it is a checkout of the operator's own already-plaintext
repository, so it exposes nothing that was not already exposed.

**``git init`` is never implicit.** Creating a repository in someone's directory is a
real, visible side effect. `ensure_repo` performs it, but only when the caller has an
explicit confirmation from the operator — the Projects UI asks at project-creation time,
not the agent mid-turn.

**A merge releases the project.** The holder map is what enforces one coding thread per
checkout, and `discard` used to be the only thing that cleared it — so a merged thread
kept the project locked forever, and the busy message told the operator to do the very
thing they had just done. Merging hands the project back. Merging a *fork* back does
not: that is one delegated agent's work rejoining its parent, and the parent is still
working.

A last thing worth knowing because it will otherwise be discovered halfway through a
session: a worktree branches from the project's base ref, so **uncommitted work in the
operator's own checkout is invisible to the agent**. `RepoProbe.uncommitted_changes`
exists so the UI can say so up front.
