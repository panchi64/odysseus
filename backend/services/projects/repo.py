"""The git primitives every worktree operation is built out of.

One invocation, the identity the chassis commits under, the branch namespace, and the
commit that has to happen before anything *reads* a branch. Split out of
``worktree.py`` because forking (``fork.py``) needs exactly these and nothing else of
what the manager knows — and importing them back out of the manager's module would be a
cycle between the two halves of one layer.
