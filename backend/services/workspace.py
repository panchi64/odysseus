"""One answer to "where does this run's file work happen".

Four subsystems used to hard-assume the agent's workspace *is* the container sandbox:
the file tools, `code_execute`, attachment staging, and the skills bundler. Each stated
it slightly differently, and one of them — `tools/files.py` — stated the invariant that
made the set coherent: *these tools reach exactly what `code_execute` reaches and nothing
else*.

Code mode moves the file work to a git worktree on the host. Re-rooting only the file
tools would break that invariant **silently**: the agent would edit a file it cannot run,
attachments would land where its file tools can't see them, and an opened skill's scripts
would point at a container that isn't in play. So the workspace stops being an assumption
scattered across four modules and becomes one resolved value:

    workspace "sandbox"  → the conversation's own container, mounted at ``/work``
    workspace "worktree" → the project's git worktree, on the host, by absolute path

Which of the two a thread gets is the mode registry's answer (``services/modes.py``), read
off ``ModeSpec.workspace`` rather than compared against a mode name here — the resolver's
job is to *build* a workspace, not to know which modes are which.

:class:`RunWorkspace` carries both halves — the host directory to act on, and
:meth:`RunWorkspace.display`, the path *string the model is told*. Those differ in a
sandbox (host `<data>/sandbox/work/<key>/x` is `/work/x` to the model) and are the same in
a worktree, which is exactly the kind of detail that goes wrong when four modules each
build it themselves.

**Attachments and skills stage under ``.odysseus/`` in a worktree.** They have to land
inside it or the file tools can't reach them, and they must not show up as the agent's
work — so :func:`prepare_worktree_workspace` makes that directory ignore itself.
