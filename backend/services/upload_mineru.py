"""High-fidelity upload extraction via MinerU — the detected-host-tool path.

MinerU turns a PDF (or image) into clean Markdown with layout, tables, and formulas
preserved — far better than the built-in text+OCR pass for complex documents. Its
model stack is heavy (PyTorch + multi-GB weights), so it is **detected, not bundled**:
the project venv never pulls it. We treat it exactly like the container runtime and the
managed SearXNG — a host capability discovered with ``shutil.which`` and shelled out to.

Crucially it runs as a **transient subprocess**: each extraction loads MinerU's models,
produces Markdown, and exits — so the models are lazy by construction and freed on exit,
with no warm server to budget against the operator's LLM. The trade is cold-start
latency per upload; a warm-server + resource-governor path is a deliberate later step.

This extractor only claims what MinerU handles (PDFs and images); anything else raises
so the composing :class:`~services.upload_extraction.FallbackExtractor` drops to the
built-in (which decodes text files). Any failure here — MinerU missing, a non-zero exit,
a timeout, no Markdown produced — propagates for the same reason: degrade, don't error.
