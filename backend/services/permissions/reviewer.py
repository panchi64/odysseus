"""The model stage — one structured call that scores an action on three named axes.

What reaches here is what the deterministic stage would not vouch for (``judge.py``):
an act whose worst case is real, or one whose worst case could not be read at all. The
question is no longer "is this provably harmless" — it is "did the operator ask for this,
and is it worth what it could cost", which is a judgement about a conversation and
therefore a model's to make.

**Three axes, not one score.** A single "is this ok" number collapses two independent
facts — how bad the act is, and whether it was wanted — and a model asked for the
collapsed answer will trade one against the other silently. Scored apart, the trade is
made *here*, in code someone can read: ``risk`` is a property of the act alone,
``authorization`` a property of the conversation alone, and ``correctness`` is the
free-text observation that catches the case neither number does — the right kind of act
aimed at the wrong thing.

**Two rules copied from LM Studio's design, both load-bearing:**

- **The prompt carries the rubric and never the passing score.** A reviewer told what
  clears the bar optimises for clearing it; a reviewer told only what the words mean
  answers the question it was asked. The combination lives in ``decide.py``, and nothing
  about it is stated here or in the prompt.
- **The transcript excludes tool results.** Everything the model has read from a file, a
  page or an MCP server is content someone else wrote, and a reviewer that saw it could be
  talked into an approval by text the attacker chose — an approval, note, of the very call
  that untrusted text asked for. So the reviewer sees the operator's own messages and the
  assistant's own prose, and nothing that came back from a tool. It is the same posture
  every other ingress in this codebase takes, applied to the one call whose output is a
  permission.

  **Including the tool results a compaction folded.** A conversation compaction writes its
  summary back as a *user* message (``services/conversations.py``), and that summary is
  built from the whole thread, tool returns and all (``agent/summarize.py``) — so a page
  the agent read once reaches this file wearing the one label the rubric treats as
  authorising. It is dropped by the marker it is written with. The cost is real and is the
  right way round: after a compaction the reviewer reads only the turns since, which is
  less to authorize on, and less authorization parks.

  **And the per-turn context riding on the operator's own prompt.** The chassis appends
  volatile context — today the agent's own task list — to the tail of the turn's user
  prompt (``agent/prelude.py``), so a *model-authored* string arrives inside the one
  message this file labels ``operator``. Only the leading item of a prompt is the
  operator's (:func:`_prompt_text`); a plan the model wrote after reading a poisoned page
  is not an authorization however the transport arranged it.

- **The turn's opening request is always in it.** Authorization is a question about what
  the operator asked for, and the answer is in the message that started the turn — the
  first thing a window counted from the end drops once the turn has run a few tools. So it
  is taken off the turn boundary and kept, and the window is spent on what came after
  (:func:`review_transcript`).

Even so, the transcript that *is* shown goes inside an untrusted fence: the assistant's
prose is downstream of everything it has read, so it can carry an injected argument
forward in its own words. Fencing it means such an argument arrives as something the
reviewer reads about, not as something it is told.

**Two things follow from that, and both are about who wrote which byte.** The prompt is
split down that line rather than by topic: what *this process* derived — the tool's name,
the paths the walk found, whether the command reaches the network, what could not be read
— stands in the clear, and every byte the *model* authored — the action's summary, and so
the command inside it — sits inside the fence with the conversation. And the conversation
is handed over as **JSON entries, not labelled lines**: a transcript rendered as
`Operator: …` is a format any message can write, so an assistant turn (or a pasted page
quoted in one) could open a second "Operator:" line and hand itself the one label the
rubric treats as authorising. A role that is a JSON field cannot be forged by the text in
the field beside it. Both fences share one nonce and one preamble, so the reviewer is told
the rule once and can still see where each block begins.

**Degradation is fail-closed and lives at the caller.** This module returns ``None`` for
every failure it can have — no model bound, a timeout, an unparseable answer — and never
a lenient verdict standing in for one. What ``None`` *means* is ``decide.py``'s to say,
and it says park.

    content from outside the conversation and are the injection vector this whole design
    is arranged around. **Tool calls** are the model's own requests, and the one being
    judged is already described far more precisely by its capability. **Thinking** is the
    model's private argument for what it is about to do, which is exactly the material a
    reviewer should not be weighing when deciding whether the *operator* asked for it.
    And a **compaction summary** is a user-shaped message the operator never wrote: a
    utility model's fold of the earlier thread, tool returns included, which would
    otherwise carry every one of them back in wearing the operator's own role.

    fourteen tools has pushed it far out of reach. Everything else is the most recent
    ``limit`` entries of prose.

    opening entry the window has already *dropped* is put back, and it is put back in
    front: having fallen out of a window counted from the end, it is by construction older
    than everything left in one. An opening entry the window still holds keeps its own
