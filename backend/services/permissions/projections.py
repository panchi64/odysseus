"""How one of *this installation's own* tools presents itself to a review.

Between "read off a grammar" (``shell_ast.py``) and "named by its argument keys"
(``capability.py``'s fallback) sits a third reading, and this table is it. A mail send, a
calendar event, a click, a vault read and a delegated task are all tools this installation
**ships**, so their argument names are a fixed vocabulary someone here can read (and a test
pins them against the real schemas, since one of those vocabularies is a dependency's) —
and describing one by its keys alone ("Calls mail_send with arguments body, subject, to")
leaves the reviewer's third axis, ``correctness``, with nothing to rule on: it can see that
an email would be sent and not who it goes to.

**Three groups, because there are three different things an argument can be worth.** A
projection says which keys *identify* the act, which carry the act's model-authored
**content**, and which may only be **measured** — a typed string is the operator's own
password as often as it is a search term, and a mail body is the one part of a send that
has no business travelling to a second model to be scored.

**Every cut says how much it withheld, and no key's budget is another key's.** Both rules
exist for the same attack. A description is assembled from values the model wrote, so a
model that pads the first key can push the deciding one off the end — and a reviewer
reading a silent ``…`` cannot tell a short argument from a long one it was shown the front
of. So each key is cut to its own limit and each cut states the full length, which turns
"the program looked harmless" into "the program is 3 510 characters and you read 2 000".

This is a table rather than a function per tool so that adding a tool is a row, and so that
the question a security reader actually has — *does anything quote a mail body* — is
answered by reading one file.
