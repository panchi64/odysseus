"""What an action would reach if it ran — its **worst case**, extracted before it runs.

A sensitivity class says what a *tool* can do; this says what *this call* would do. The
difference is the whole reason a level can be reviewed rather than only asked about:
``shell_run_command`` is host execution whatever its arguments say, but `git status` and
`rm -rf ~` are not the same act, and something has to be able to tell them apart without
asking the operator.

**Worst case, never likely case.** Everything here reads an action the way an attacker
would write it. A command is what its syntax permits, not what its author says it does; a
path argument is where it could land, not where it probably lands. That bias is what makes
the extraction usable by a judge that auto-approves: over-describing an action costs a
model call, under-describing one costs the operator something they never agreed to.

**How much can be said varies by tool, and saying so is part of the answer.** A shell
command is read off a grammar (``shell_ast.py``); a file write is one resolved path; an
MCP call is a server, a tool name and a set of argument *keys*, because its effect is
defined on the far side of an API this process cannot see. That last case is not a gap to
be filled in later — it is the honest description, and it is why
:attr:`Capability.unbounded` exists rather than an optimistic empty set.

**One family is the exception to the opening sentence, and deliberately so.** For a tool
the shipped catalog classifies as a *read*, "what this call would do" and "what this tool
can do" are the same fact: it returns something and leaves nothing different behind,
whatever its arguments say. Those calls are described from the class alone
(:attr:`ActionKind.READ`) — not because reading arguments would be hard, but because
there is nothing in them left to find.

**Between "read off a grammar" and "named by its argument keys" sits a third reading, and
it lives next door** (``projections.py``): the per-tool table that says how one of this
installation's *own* tools presents itself, because describing a mail send by its keys
alone ("Calls mail_send with arguments body, subject, to") leaves the reviewer's third
axis, ``correctness``, with nothing to rule on. That table is a separate module for the
reason it is a table at all — it changes when a shipped tool's arguments change, which is
not when this file's reading of a *deferred call* changes, and the question a security
reader has of it ("does anything quote a mail body") is one they should be able to answer
by reading one file.

**A projection makes a review better informed; it never makes one unnecessary.** These
capabilities stay :attr:`ActionKind.OPAQUE` with a non-empty :attr:`Capability.unbounded`,
because quoting four arguments of a mail send does not turn the far side of a mail server
into something this process read. Nothing here can be cleared by ``judge.py``, before or
after — only the amount the model reviewer has to work with changed.
