"""What to do with a tool call the model wants to make — one function, four answers.

The engine reaches here at the single point where Pydantic AI hands back a *deferred*
call: a call the library declined to execute and returned for someone to rule on. Two
things put a call in that list, and telling them apart is the whole job of this module:

- **the level put it there.** The toolset marks every tool that reaches past the level's
  ceiling as needing approval (``tools/toolsets.py``), so the model's request for one
  comes back undone. This is the level's own question, and the level's approval policy
  answers it: withheld under Plan (so the call is refused outright rather than asked
  about), parked under Manual and Edit, reviewed under Auto.
- **the tool put itself there.** A global recall, a skill edit, an untrusted external
  tool — tools that gate their own calls for reasons this axis knows nothing about. Those
  are the operator's to answer, which is why they come back ``ASK`` even under a level
  whose scope would have permitted them. A level widens a gate; it never narrows one
  (``levels.py``). Auto is not an exception to that: it answers them by review because
  answering on the operator's behalf is the whole of what choosing Auto means.

**Why the vocabulary has four members when the knobs produce three.** ``ALLOW`` is what a
standing conversation grant produces — the operator's explicit "stop asking me about this
one" — and it is also the verdict Auto's review returns for a call it clears. Expressing
both in the same vocabulary is what keeps the engine to one dispatch. Note where the grant
sits in that dispatch (``agent/gating.py``): it answers a question this module *asked*,
and never overturns a refusal. A grant is consent to skip a prompt, not consent to act in
a thread the operator set to act in nothing. **At Auto it does not answer the question at
all** — it is carried into the review as the operator's authorization (:func:`review`),
because at that level the question was never "may this tool run" but "what would this call
do", and a grant on `shell_run_command` is not an answer to that for every command.

**The second half of this module is that review** (:func:`review`), which is what
``REVIEW`` resolves to: the deterministic stage first (``judge.py``), the model second
(``reviewer.py``), and the arithmetic over their answers here — deliberately *here*,
where a reader can see the whole rule at once and where the reviewer cannot read it.

    ``nonce`` is the fence token this call's untrusted blocks carry. A caller reviewing a
    *batch* over one transcript passes one for the whole batch, so the shared prose at the
    front of every prompt is byte-identical and an engine can serve it from the prefix it
    already processed (``reviewer.ReviewRequest.nonce``). Omitted, one is minted for this
    call alone — the safe default, and what a single review wants.

    ``fenced`` is the fact about the *host* the deterministic stage needs and cannot look
    up for itself (``judge.py`` is pure). It defaults to the strict reading — no fence —
    because a caller that could not say is a caller with nothing to hold a command to, and
    the cost of being wrong that way is a model call rather than an act nobody cleared.

    ``granted`` is how far the operator's standing conversation grant reaches over this
    call (``services/approval_grants.py``). At every other level a grant of either width
    *is* the answer and settles the call; here the two widths part, because here the
    question is what one particular call would do.

    A ``"command"`` grant is an **input to the review**. It names one act, so it is not an
    answer about every call the tool could make — the grant supplies the authorization and
    the rest of the review still runs, which is what keeps one tick under a test run from
    switching the review off for every command in the thread. It supplies that
    authorization only where the reviewer had **nothing** to say: a reviewer that read the
    operator as having refused this act in this very turn is reading their most recent
    word, and a grant left earlier in the thread does not get to outrank it.

    A ``"tool"`` grant *is* that answer, and is read as one. The operator was offered the
    wider width in its own words — this tool, everything it runs, for this thread — and
    picked it, so the review takes it as their authorization outright rather than only
    where it found a gap. **It reaches the risk axis too**, and is the only thing that
    does: a ``too_destructive`` verdict runs under a whole-tool grant and parks under
    every other (:func:`_verdict_decision`).

    That is the one place the level hands an unrecoverable act over without showing it,
    and it is deliberate. A tool whose act cannot be *read* by the review — arbitrary
    script in the operator's own browser is the case that forced this, since the projection
    withholds the script precisely so a password cannot reach the reviewer — draws the same
    contentless verdict on every call, so it would be re-asked forever however the operator
    answered. Offering a standing yes that can never take effect is worse than honouring
    the one they gave: it is the same promise the card makes, and the same promise Manual
    and Edit have always kept, where a grant of either width settles the call before the
    risk axis is consulted at all. A ``"command"`` grant is not enough for this — agreeing
    to an act is not agreeing that the act is recoverable — and neither is a reviewer's own
    reading of the turn.

    **Both widths are inputs to a review that *ran*.** Where there is no reviewer at all
    there is nothing for a grant to authorize, so the call parks like every other
    unreviewable one — and that is the case the wider width most needs to keep, since a
    grant that settled the call outright here would switch the level off on any
    installation with no utility model bound, where nothing would ever have looked at the
    act to say whether it was recoverable.

    The combination, stated once here and written down nowhere the reviewer can read it
    (``reviewer.py``):

    - the deterministic stage's approval **runs**, with no model call at all;
    - ``too_destructive`` **parks**, unless the operator holds a whole-tool grant over the
      tool — it is the one act they most need to be shown rather than told about
      afterwards, and the only thing that outranks that is their own standing word,
      given in the width whose copy says so;
    - ``low`` risk **runs** unless the operator said no;
    - ``high`` risk runs **only** on an explicit yes;
    - everything else **parks**, and so does every way this can fail.

    Note what is deliberately absent: ``correctness`` moves nothing. It is an observation
    for the operator to read on the review row, not a fourth term — a reviewer that could
    veto on "this looks like the wrong path" would be second-guessing the model's work
    rather than ruling on its permission, and those are different jobs.
