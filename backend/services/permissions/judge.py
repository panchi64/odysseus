"""The deterministic stage — the answer that costs nothing, and the shape of it.

Most of what an agent does at the Auto level is ordinary work inside the directory it was
given: `git status`, `ls src`, `uv run pytest`, `mkdir -p a/b`, `git commit -m wip`.
Sending each of those to a model costs a round trip, a second of latency and a chance of
being wrong about something structure already settles. So the first stage rules
structurally, and only what it declines reaches the reviewer.

**It has exactly one power: to approve.** A capability this stage does not recognise is
not refused — it is *escalated*, which is a different thing and the reason this file can
afford to be as strict as it is. Narrowing it costs model calls; widening it costs the
operator's trust, and only one of those is recoverable.

**There is no list of programs here, and that is the change this file exists to state.**
An allowlist of read-only programs answers "what will this binary do", which is a question
about software nobody in this repository maintains — every row was a claim someone had to
re-check against a man page, and the rows that mattered (`git diff` running whatever
`diff.external` names) could not be written at all. The question this stage asks now is
answerable from three facts it can actually establish:

- **structure** — what the command's syntax names, read off a grammar (``shell_ast.py``):
  which paths, which redirects, which environment assignments, and every construct that
  could not be read at all;
- **a declared reach** — ``workspace``, ``network`` or ``host``, stated by the model on the
  call itself (:data:`~services.permissions.capability.Reach`);
- **an OS fence** — whether this host can actually *hold* a process to that reach
  (``services/sandbox/fence.py``: seatbelt on macOS, bubblewrap on Linux).

The declaration is what makes the structure decidable and the fence is what holds a command
to most of it: a command declaring ``workspace`` runs under a profile that permits writing
the worktree and nothing else and reaching no network, so a write or an egress beyond what
it declared fails *inside* the fence instead of quietly succeeding. **Reads are the
exception, and the one place structure carries the whole weight**: the runtime has a read
denylist and no read allowlist (``services/sandbox/fence.py``), so nothing downstream will
catch a read outside the worktree that this stage cleared. That is why the extraction
refuses a word it cannot place as a single path (``shell_ast.py``) rather than measuring it
optimistically, and why a path that escapes is refused here before anything else is asked.

**And it is why "relative to the workspace root" has to stay true.** A shell session
persists its working directory between calls, so a relative path is judged as relative to
the root — an assumption that is load-bearing for every command cleared here, and that
only the fence can keep: its `cd`-persistence shim steps into what the command left the
shell in **only while that is still under the root** (``services/sandbox/fence.py``). Let
the tracked directory out of the worktree and every containment answer below is measured
against a directory the command is no longer in.

This stage's job is to check that the three agree — and to refuse whenever they do not, or
whenever one of them is missing.

**Three kinds of act clear here, and each on its own ground** (:data:`Tier` records which):

- a **classified read** (``ActionKind.READ``): the class is a claim about the tool itself —
  it returns something and leaves nothing different behind — so no argument set makes it
  into another kind of act and there is no reviewer question left to ask. This is what
  keeps a self-gated recall (``corpus_retrieve``, ``conversations_search``) from costing a
  model call every time, and what stops it from parking a run outright on an installation
  with no utility model bound. Only a *classified* name reaches it: an unknown one resolves
  to the class that reaches furthest, so nothing an operator's own MCP server names can
  arrive wearing a read's clothes;
- an **offline sandbox call**: the conversation's container is itself the fence, so the
  program inside it needs no reading. This is the one branch that clears a capability the
  extraction marked unbounded, and deliberately: for an interpreter there is no reading of
  the arguments that would ever bound it, and the boundary was never the arguments;
- a **contained command** at ``workspace`` — every path it names inside the worktree, no
  network, and a fence available to hold it there.

**A ``network`` declaration is not a fourth one, and the asymmetry is deliberate.** The
fence bounds writes and egress and cannot bound *reads*, so a command cleared at
``workspace`` can already read whatever the operator's account can — and the only way that
leaves the machine is a command that reaches out. An allowed-domains list does not make
that safe: the seed names hosts that accept uploads as readily as they serve downloads, so
`git push` of copied data is inside it. So every networked command goes to the model
reviewer, whatever the operator has allowed, and the allowed list stays what the *fence*
holds an approved one to (``tools/shell.py``) rather than what clears it.

**Everything else escalates, and the reason says which of the three facts was missing** —
an unreadable construct, a path outside the worktree, a `host` declaration, a declaration
the command's own syntax contradicts, a host with no fence, or a reach into the network.
That reason is what an operator reads on the review row, and "the system was arbitrary" is
the reading it exists to prevent.

**Pure, and pure on purpose.** Nothing here probes the host or reads settings: whether a
fence exists arrives as an argument, so the same call is decidable in a test, at the gate
(``agent/gating.py``) and again inside the tool that executes it (``tools/shell.py``) —
and those three cannot drift into disagreeing about what was cleared.
