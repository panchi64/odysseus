"""Built-in utility tools — the minimal starter category.

Real capabilities (memory, web, email, shell, …) arrive as their services land;
each becomes a thin tool over a ``services/`` capability. This category exists
so the toolset stack has something to compose and gate today.

``ask_user`` is the exception to that shape: it is backed by no service at all,
because the thing it reaches for is the operator. It **defers** rather than
returning — the call parks the turn, the operator answers in the interface, and
the answer arrives as this tool's return value on the resume.
