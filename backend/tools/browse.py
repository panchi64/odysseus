"""The `browse` category — the agent drives a real page instead of only reading one.

`pydantic_ai_harness`'s `PlaywrightBrowserToolset`: navigate, read the accessibility tree,
click, type, press keys, choose options, hover, wait, scroll, go back and forward, run
JavaScript, manage tabs, answer dialogs, and read the page's console and network log.

**This is not `web_fetch`, and the difference is what it is for.** Fetch renders a URL and
hands back its text — one page, no state, nothing to click. These tools keep a browser
open *across* calls and across turns, which is what a login, a multi-step form, or an app
that only exists after JavaScript runs actually needs.

**Using the toolset alone meant the model was never told any of that**
(:func:`browse_instructions`). `PlaywrightBrowser` is two things — a per-run browser
lifecycle we replace, and the when-to-use-it guidance that comes with the tools — and
taking the toolset by itself
quietly left the second behind. The model got eighteen tool schemas and no account of how
they fit together: which tool reads a page, that `aria-ref` handles come from `snapshot`,
what to do about an iframe or a spinner, that a second tab exists. Guessing at all of that
is what a browsing turn looked like, and it read as the model being bad at browsing rather
than as never having been told.

**The session is the conversation's, not the run's.** `PlaywrightBrowser` (the capability)
opens a browser when a run starts and closes it when the run ends; that lifecycle is
bypassed here in favour of `services/browser`'s conversation-scoped manager, so the page
the operator is looking at when a turn finishes is the page the next turn continues on.
What is used from the harness is the toolset alone — the eighteen tools over a session we
own. See `tools/rebound.py` for why the tools are *defined* by a template and *dispatched*
through a per-conversation instance.

**The window is the operator's too.** These tools drive a visible Chromium on the
operator's own machine, one window per conversation, which they can click in themselves —
to log in before handing the thread over, or to do a step faster than describing it.
Nothing announces what they did; the model simply re-reads the page with `snapshot` or
`get_text` like it would after any other change.

**Degrades, never fails.** A window that could not be launched — no Chromium, or its SSRF
proxy refusing to start — means there is nothing to attach to; the tools say so and the
model moves on, exactly as web fetch does under the same conditions.

**And the operator can close it at any moment, which is not the same failure.** A window
they closed is a thing they chose, so the tools report *that* — the page is gone, the
login is not, and they may simply be done — instead of launching a replacement window on
their screen mid-turn. Only `navigate` reopens (:data:`REOPENING_TOOLS`), because a
navigation is the model deliberately starting somewhere; a `click` that silently opened a
fresh blank window would let it believe the click landed. An *idle* reap is ours rather
than theirs and stays invisible: the next call re-attaches with the login restored.

    capability cannot know: that the window is on the operator's screen, that the session
    outlives the turn, and that either of them can end it.

    **Silent until a browser is open, which is the whole reason this is affordable.** The
    category is dormant precisely because eighteen schemas on every request of every
    conversation is the most expensive thing in the catalog; a page of prose about them,
    shipped to every thread that never browses, would undo that. A live session is the
    cheapest honest signal that this thread is browsing — no I/O, no lookup — and it is
    stable for as long as the browsing lasts, so the head of the request stays byte-stable
    across the turns that matter for the prompt cache.

    The first `navigate` of a thread therefore runs uninstructed, and that is the accepted
    cost: the dormant index already says what the category is for, the model has just read
    the tool schemas it asked to be shown, and every call after the browser is open has the
    full text in front of it.
