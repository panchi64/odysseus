"""The sub-agent roster this run may launch from — built-ins plus the project's own.

A project declares sub-agents in files (``services/subagents/definitions.py``); which
project that is depends on the run, so the roster cannot be assembled once at startup
alongside the toolset. This is the same seam ``tools/repo.py`` uses for a project's
instruction files, for the same reasons and with the same memoisation:

**Resolved per run, cached per run.** The roster is read where the model is deciding —
inside ``get_tools``, which is called on *every* model request, up to the request limit for
a single turn. Re-walking ``.claude/agents`` and re-parsing every file twenty-five times
over an unchanged checkout would be pure waste; worse, an agent that edited one of those
files mid-turn would rewrite the launch tool's description under itself and invalidate the
whole turn's prefix cache. Keyed by the run rather than by the directory so the next turn
still re-reads — a later turn is exactly where a project's agent files may legitimately
have changed since.

**Worktree modes only.** A sandbox workspace is scratch space with no repository in it to
declare anything, so outside a worktree this is the built-ins and nothing else — and, more
to the point, no filesystem walk at all.
