"""Owning the events the harness's own toolsets emit.

Several `pydantic_ai_harness` capabilities — `planning`, `filesystem`, `subagents`,
`compaction`, `system_reminders`, `spend` — emit `CapabilityEvent`s from inside their tool
functions. This codebase registers those toolsets **directly** rather than registering the
capabilities that own them, deliberately: a capability contributes its tools itself, which
would put them outside the namespaced, operator-toggleable catalog whose whole promise is
that the settings list and the agent's real stack cannot diverge (`tools/CLAUDE.md`).

Pydantic AI now refuses a `CapabilityEvent` it cannot attribute to a registered capability,
which turned that choice into a crash: the harness emits, the library cannot name an owner,
and the `UserError` takes the turn with it. Attribution needs two things, and a lifted
toolset has neither:

1. **A registered capability to attribute to.** :func:`harness_events_capability` is that,
   and it is deliberately empty — no tools, no instructions, no hooks — so it cannot
   reintroduce the tools or the prompt injection that made the capability form the rejected
   shape. One owner covers every lifted toolset, because the id is an attribution handle
   rather than a claim about behaviour, and nothing here consumes these events: the
   product's own frames are emitted by `services/` and matched in `agent/translate.py` by
   `isinstance`, so the harness's fall through unread.

2. **A `capability_id` on the tool definition the call arrived through**, which the library
   reads off `tool_manager.tools[ctx.tool_name]`. :func:`own_harness_events` stamps it, and
   `tools/toolsets.py` applies that to the whole catalog — safe for every tool rather than
   only the lifted ones, because both places the field gates a tool require the owning
   capability to have `defer_loading=True`, and this owner never does.

The second half has a wrinkle that :func:`attributable` closes. That registry is keyed by
the *namespaced* name (`tasks_write`), but a `PrefixedToolset` rewrites `ctx.tool_name` to
the *unprefixed* one (`write`) before delegating inward — so the lookup misses for every
prefixed toolset, which is all of ours. A wrapper that delegates to a harness toolset
restates the namespaced name on the way in.
