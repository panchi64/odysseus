"""Toolsets whose tools are fixed but whose *backing object* is not.

Several categories wrap a `pydantic_ai_harness` toolset that is constructed around
something a run resolves rather than the app: `files`, `shell` and `repo` around a
directory, `browse` around a conversation's live browser. Categories are assembled once at
app startup and shared by every conversation, so none of them can bake that in at
construction.

`AbstractToolset.for_run(ctx)` is not the hook for this, and it is worth saying why since
it looks like it: the library does call it once per run, but a harness toolset's `for_run`
rebuilds from **construction-time** values (`ShellToolset.for_run` passes its own
`_initial_cwd`). It isolates mutable per-run state — a `cd` that drifted the cwd, a
background process handle — between concurrent runs, which is real and useful, but it
cannot root two conversations at two different directories. That is exactly what is
needed here.

So the shape is: answer `get_tools` from a template bound to nothing real, because a
tool's *definition* — name, description, JSON schema — does not depend on where it will
act, which is what keeps the operator-facing catalog identical to the agent's real stack;
then re-resolve the tool from a correctly-bound instance inside `call_tool`. Pydantic AI
dispatches through `tool.call_func`, which is bound to the instance that produced it, so
delegating the call alone would still act on the template. That is the whole trick, and
:class:`ReboundToolset` is the one place it is implemented.

> A test that would pass while being wrong: "two runs don't share a cwd" is satisfied by
> `for_run` alone, with both runs rooted at the template's path. Assert the **roots
> differ and match their own conversations' workspaces**. The same trap applies to a
> browser session: "two conversations got different toolsets" passes while both drive the
> template's page.
