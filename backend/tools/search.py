"""Web tools — the agent's thin adapters over the web capabilities.

Two verbs reached through ``RunDeps``: ``search`` over
:class:`~services.search.SearchService` (SearXNG) and ``fetch`` over
:class:`~services.webfetch.BrowserFetcher` (render the page in a headless browser, extract
to Markdown). No logic here — it lives in the services. The results are typed dataclasses
Pydantic AI serializes for the model, already untrusted-wrapped by the service.

Failure handling leans on the engine: a *recoverable* fetch failure (a blocked or
unreadable URL) raises :class:`ModelRetry`, so Pydantic AI feeds the reason back
and the model tries a different source — bounded by the tool's retry budget. A
*missing* capability (web not wired, or no provider configured) returns a plain
message instead, the same graceful-degradation shape as the memory tools — a retry
can't fix it.

**A repeat is refused before it costs anything.** A thread that reads widely — a research
thread most of all — loops: it re-asks a search it already ran, or re-fetches a page whose
text is already sitting in its own context, and pays a full network round trip and a second
copy of the result for nothing. The run's :class:`~services.search.DedupeSets`
(``RunDeps.web_dedupe``) is *claimed* before the call and handed back if the call then
failed, so a search that errored or a page that refused to render stays eligible while two
parallel calls for the same thing cannot both slip past the check. The refusal says plainly
that the answer is already in the transcript, because a bare "no results" would read as
"the web has nothing" and send the model looking again.

A search's key is its whole request — the query *and* the arguments that change what comes
back — so narrowing a question to the last day is a new read rather than a repeat of the
same words. Continuing a long page is the same idea for ``fetch``: ``offset > 0`` is the
documented way to page through a truncated result, so it is never deduped.
