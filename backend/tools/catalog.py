"""The operator-facing tool catalog — every tool, named exactly as the agent sees it.

`AE-3.3` lets the operator disable individual tools, which means the settings surface has
to *list* them. That list is **derived from the same assembled category mapping the agent
runs against** (core categories + every feature manifest's ``toolsets`` export, assembled
at app startup), never hand-maintained: a tool that lands in a category appears here the
day it lands, and one that is renamed or removed cannot leave a stale row behind that
disables nothing. Callers pass that mapping in — this module holds no registry of its own.

Names are namespaced the way :meth:`AbstractToolset.prefixed` namespaces them —
``f"{category}_{tool}"`` — because that is the name the enabled gate matches on and the
name the model is offered. ``tests/test_tool_policy.py`` pins that convention against the
tool definitions a real agent run resolves, so a change in the library's prefixing is a
failing test rather than a settings screen whose toggles quietly stop applying.

**Scope.** Every category today is a Pydantic AI ``FunctionToolset``, whose tools are
known statically. A future toolset that resolves its tools dynamically (an external MCP
server, `MCP-*`) has nothing to enumerate here and contributes no rows — such tools carry
their own operator-facing trust surface (`AE-3.6`).

    Three sources, one list:

      assembled mapping the agent runs against, so a new one is covered the day it lands;
    - **conditionally gated** — ``gated_tools``: tools that raise ``ApprovalRequired``

      therefore can't be discovered by inspection. Each feature manifest declares its
      own (``gated_tools``); the app assembles the union alongside the categories;
    - **external** — read from the operator's own sources.
