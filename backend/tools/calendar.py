"""Calendar tools — the agent's thin adapter over the calendar capability (`CAL-1..3`).

Thin pass-throughs to :class:`~services.calendar.CalendarService` reached via ``RunDeps``;
every rule about zones, recurrence expansion, and validation lives in the service, which is
the same one the REST routes call.

**No approval gate.** Creating, editing, and deleting the operator's own calendar entries
on their behalf is ordinary assistant work — it is not in the `AE-3.1` sensitive set (shell,
code execution, filesystem writes, sending mail, serving models, config, the vault), all of
which reach outside the operator's own data or are hard to undo. A calendar entry is neither:
it is visible on the surface the operator is looking at and one call to remove. Gating it
would train the operator to click through approvals, which is what makes a gate stop working
where it matters.

If the calendar isn't wired into the run, each tool says so rather than failing — the model
adapts (graceful degradation), the same posture the memory tools take.
