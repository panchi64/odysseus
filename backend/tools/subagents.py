"""The `subagents` category — handing a self-contained piece of work to another agent.

Four tools, and the shape of them is the design. One hands work over; the other three exist
because handing it over is not the same as forgetting about it — `send` changes what a
sub-agent was asked for while it still can, `list` says what is still out, and `read` says
where one has got to.

**`launch` does not wait.** A sub-agent runs as its own Run on the same substrate and
takes minutes. Blocking this turn on it would spend the turn's whole step budget watching
a progress bar — which is exactly what the delegation this replaced did, and the reason a
five-minute sub-agent used to mean a five-minute silence. So `launch` returns the moment
the run is submitted, and says so in words: the model can launch several in one step,
carry on, and end its turn. It is told what each one found as each one finishes.

**The roster is generated, not written.** The one place the model reads what it may launch
is this tool's description, because that is where it is deciding — a standing instruction
at the prompt head would say the same thing a second time inside the cached prefix, and
say it furthest from the choice. Generating it from the roster is what stops the classic
failure: a hand-written list naming sub-agents that no longer exist and omitting the ones
that do, with nothing to make the two disagree loudly.

**And regenerated per run**, because a project declares sub-agents of its own in files and
which project that is depends on the run. The description is rewritten in `get_tools` from
the run's own roster, so a repository's `reviewer` is one the model can actually see rather
than one it would have to be told about separately — and one the model *could* not see is
one that may as well not exist.

**Only a sub-agent that can write is gated.** Reading changes nothing, and asking about it
would be a question with one sensible answer asked over and over. One that edits does work
the operator's own merge will carry out, so launching it is theirs to allow — once per
conversation, if they grant it that far.

{roster}

It returns **immediately** and does not wait; never poll for one in a loop. Launch as many
as the work genuinely splits into, issuing the calls together, then carry on with whatever
does not depend on them and end your turn when nothing is left. **You will be told what
each found as it finishes.** Some may queue rather than start at once — that is throughput,
not failure: every one you launched will run and will report.

Launch one when a piece of work needs a lot of reading or editing and the steps themselves
are not what the operator wants to see. Not for work you could do in a couple of tool
calls: the round trip costs more than it saves.

`task` has to stand alone — the sub-agent starts from an empty history and never sees this
conversation. Say what to do, where to start, and what a finished answer looks like; "the
bug we discussed" describes nothing it can act on.

`isolate` gives it its own copy of the workspace, merged back when it finishes, instead of
your files. Ask for it when you mean to keep editing meanwhile: two agents in one tree is
fine when one is waiting and a mess when neither is. A file you both changed comes back as
a reported conflict rather than silently taking one side.

Once one is running you are not stuck with what you asked for: `subagents_send` amends a
sub-agent's brief while it works, and `subagents_list` says which of yours are still out.
