"""Password-vault tools (`VAULT-2`) — the agent's read access to the operator's secrets.

See ``tools/mail.py`` for why the category is registered before it exists.

The agent reading the operator's secrets manager is an explicitly sensitive action, so
**every** tool here carries ``requires_approval=True`` — the static marking, as in
``tools/code.py``'s ``run_host_command``. The marking is static rather than conditional on
purpose: there is no shape of vault read that is routine enough to be waved through, and a
condition is one more thing that can be wrong. Each call takes a plain-language ``reason``
that rides onto the approval prompt, so the operator judges *why* a credential is wanted
without reconstructing it from the conversation.

Thin, like every tool: the lock, the key, and the sealing live in ``services/secret_vault``.
A locked vault is reported back as a fact the model can act on (ask the operator to unlock),
not raised — the model retrying cannot open a lock only the operator can.
