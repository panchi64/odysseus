"""What the agent already has on disk, told to it once per turn.

The model's own file tools report only the call they just made — `code_execute`
returns two streams, `files_write_file` returns a byte count — and nothing has ever
put the *state* of the workspace in front of it. So knowing what it had already built
depended entirely on the tool calls still being in the replayed history, and a
compaction (`agent/summarize.py`) replaces that stretch with a summary. Past the fold,
a conversation's own files became invisible to it, and it rebuilt them.

This block is the fix, and it is deliberately the dullest possible one: read the
directory, list what is in it, every turn. It is derived from disk rather than
remembered, so it is correct after a fold, after a reap, after a restart, and after a
turn that the model itself has forgotten.

**It goes at the tail, and that placement is the whole cost argument.** A file listing
changes on nearly every step, and a changing block at the *head* of the request
invalidates the inference engine's prompt-prefix cache from byte 0 for the entire
conversation behind it (`tools/deps.py`, `agent/factory.py`). At the tail it is a few
hundred tokens on the turn it rides, and the history in front of it stays byte-stable.

**It creates nothing.** Not a session, not a directory — see `settled_workspace`. A
turn that never touches a file must not pay for a container's worth of bookkeeping to
be told there is nothing to say. And it runs **off the event loop**: the walk is
ordinary blocking IO over a directory the agent controls the size of, so it goes
through a thread like every other workspace walk in this codebase.
