"""How much of a project's own `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` reaches the prompt head.

These files land in the standing brief — cache-stable, re-sent every turn, ahead of the
conversation — which is exactly what makes them worth loading and exactly what makes an
unbudgeted load dangerous. A repository whose instruction file has grown to a couple of
hundred kilobytes (they do; they accrete) silently spends the whole window before the
model has read a single message, and the only visible symptom is that long threads start
compacting early. The capability that loads them has no cap of its own, so the cap lives
here, on our side of the seam.

**Whole files are dropped before any file is cut.** Discovery hands them back
broadest-first and most-specific-last, which is also least-to-most relevant: the file
sitting in the directory the agent is actually working in is the one whose sentences it
needs, and half a broad file is worth less than none of it plus all of a narrow one. Only
when the most specific file *alone* overruns the budget is anything truncated — and then
it is truncated with a visible marker at a line boundary, because a brief that stops
mid-sentence reads as a corrupted instruction rather than a shortened one.

Bytes rather than tokens because that is what is actually being defended (a UTF-8 file on
disk) and because a byte cap needs no tokenizer to be exact. The number is a budget, not
an estimate, so nothing here is scaled or approximated.
