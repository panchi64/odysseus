"""`run_workspace(ctx)` — the workspace resolver, as a tool sees it.

`services/workspace.py` holds the resolution; this is the half that reads it off
`RunDeps` and the capability bag, so a tool asks one question and gets one answer rather
than each reaching for `SandboxSessionManager` and branching on mode itself. Two
spellings, one answer: tools hold a `RunContext`, and the approval gate — which has to
resolve the workspace *before* any tool has run, to judge a command's paths against the
directory it will actually run in — holds only the run's deps.

The answer is memoised **on the run's own deps**, not in a module-level cache: a code
turn's first call does real work (`git worktree add`, a branch checkout) and a turn makes
many file-tool calls, but the memo must die with the run rather than outlive it in a
global. Only a successful resolution is kept — a sandbox that failed to open may open on
the next call, and the failure path costs nothing to retry.
