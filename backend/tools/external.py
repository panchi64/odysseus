"""External tools — MCP servers + third-party connectors (`MCP-*`, `INTEG-*`, `AE-3.6`).

Every other category is a fixed catalog written here. This one is not: its tools are
whatever the operator's registered servers and configured connectors happen to expose, so
the category resolves itself *while a run is being composed* rather than at import.

**We do not hand-roll an MCP client.** A connected server is already an
``AbstractToolset`` (Pydantic AI's ``MCPToolset``), so it drops into the stack unchanged
and the model calls its tools exactly as it calls ours. A connector's actions are wrapped
in an ordinary ``FunctionToolset``. This module composes those, and adds the one thing the
library can't know: policy.

**External tools are sensitive by default (`AE-3.6`).** They are precisely the case the
`AE-3` sensitivity model can't enumerate — their effects are unknown to the system and may
be externally visible — so every call pauses for approval unless the operator has marked
*that specific tool* trusted. Trust is per tool, never per server: registering or enabling
a server says nothing about what any tool on it does. The gate is runtime-conditional, so
it follows ``tools/recall_gate.py``'s shape (raise ``ApprovalRequired`` unless
``ctx.tool_call_approved``) rather than the static ``requires_approval=True`` marking, and
it re-reads the decision on every call so revoking trust takes effect immediately.

The conversation-scoped auto-approval grants (`AE-3.7`) keep working unchanged on top of
this: the engine resolves them by the namespaced tool name before the call reaches here.
