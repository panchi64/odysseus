"""The `repo` category — what a codebase already says about how to work in it.

`pydantic_ai_harness`'s `RepoContext`, split across the two seams this codebase has for
model-facing text:

- **the instructions half** — a project's own `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`, loaded from the
  worktree root and handed to the model as standing instructions. Registered as an
  `InstructionProvider` rather than through the capability's `get_instructions`, because
  the capability is constructed once at app assembly and the workspace is per-run; a
  provider re-resolves each turn and can therefore read the run's own worktree. The
  content is static per project, so it stays cache-stable at the prompt head even though
  it is resolved dynamically — and it is **memoised for the run** rather than re-read,
  because a provider resolves on every model request and a turn makes up to
  `agent_request_limit` of them: the file walk, the SHA256 dedup and the budget's UTF-8
  encodes would otherwise run twenty-five times over an unchanged worktree, and an agent
  that edited the project's own `CLAUDE.md` mid-turn would rewrite the prompt head under
  itself and invalidate the whole turn's prefix cache. The loading itself is ours rather
  than the capability's (`repo_instructions.py`) for one reason: it has to be *budgeted*,
  and the capability reads whatever is on disk.
- **the inventory tool** — reports where the repo keeps its coding-assistant assets
  (`.claude/`, `.agents/`, `.codex/` and their `skills/`, `agents/`, `settings.json`). It
  locates them; reading them is the file tools' job. Rebound per run like every other
  workspace-rooted category.

Both are no-ops outside a worktree mode: a sandbox workspace is scratch space, and there
is no repository in it to have an opinion.
