"""Taking the model's ``narration`` back off a call before anything tries to validate it.

The other half of the argument ``tools/describe.py`` adds. A tool above a pure read is
offered a ``narration`` property — one sentence saying why *this* call, now — so the work
log can show intent beside arguments. No tool function declares it, and nothing below this
file should have to: the sentence is for the operator, not for the capability.

**Why a hook and not a parameter.** Pydantic AI validates a call against the tool
function's own signature with extras forbidden, so an argument no function declares is a
``ValidationError``, which the library turns into a retry prompt — the model is told its
call was malformed for using the property the schema offered it, and does it again. The
obvious alternative fails in the same place: a ``prepared`` stage can put the property on
the wire for free, but the wire is not where the cost lands. Nor is a toolset wrapper
enough — ``WrapperToolset.call_tool`` runs *after* validation, and validation is the thing
that rejects the key. What runs before it is ``before_tool_validate``, which the library
offers every non-output tool call, and that is all this capability implements.

**Idempotence is a requirement, not a nicety.** An approved call is re-validated when the
run resumes, through the same hook, and a hook that assumed it was seeing a fresh call
would be fine here only by luck. Both branches below are written so a second pass over
already-stripped arguments returns them unchanged and untouched.

**Unparseable arguments pass straight through.** A model can emit a JSON fragment this
capability cannot read; the validator has a far better account of what is wrong with it
than a stripper does, and swallowing or rewriting the payload here would replace a precise
error with a confusing one.
