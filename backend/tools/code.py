"""Code & shell tools — the agent's two execution paths, cleanly split.

``code_execute`` is the default: it runs in the host-isolated sandbox, so being
contained it carries no host-level risk and the agent computes freely.
``code_run_host_command`` is the deliberate exception: it runs on the real host, so
its request must carry a plain-language ``explanation`` the operator can judge
without reading the command.

``code_request_egress`` is the third, and the only one that widens anything: compute
is free inside the box, but reaching a host the allowlist does not name is an exit,
so it is asked for by name and approved per call. Nothing else here is gated on the
network — the walls around a workspace are not the thing worth guarding.

``code_execute``'s description is the **only** place the model is told what machine
a run happens on — said where it is deciding whether to call, and nowhere else, so
a thread with no sandbox is never handed a description of one.

Both stay thin — the execution mechanics live in ``services/sandbox`` (the
sandboxed path and the host escape hatch). When no sandbox runtime is available
the sandboxed tool reports the capability is disabled and the model adapts; it
never silently falls back to the host.
