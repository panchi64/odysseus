"""Plan mode's three tools — enter it, read the plan, submit one for approval.

The counterpart to ``tools/tasks.py``. That one is the running checklist the agent keeps
for itself at every level; this is the written document a Plan-level turn produces for the
operator to say yes to. They were one word and one feature once, which is why neither
module now uses the other's.

**The level moves from inside the run, and takes effect inside the turn.** Both
``plan_enter`` and an approved ``plan_submit`` change what the thread may do, and both do it
by writing the conversation row *and* by editing ``ctx.deps`` in place. The second half is
what makes it real immediately: ``RunDeps`` is a plain dataclass, and both gates in
``tools/toolsets.py`` re-read it on every model request, so the narrowed — or widened —
catalog lands on the very next request rather than next turn. Without it, ``plan_enter``
would be an announcement the model could ignore for the rest of the turn, and an approved
plan would be an agreement the model had no tools to carry out.

**``plan_submit`` raises ``ApprovalRequired`` from inside the call** rather than carrying
``requires_approval=True``, and the difference is load-bearing. The static marking defers
the call *before* the body runs, and the body is what records the plan — so the panel would
have nothing to render while the operator decided, and a reload mid-decision would find no
document. Raising from inside means the first invocation writes and announces the plan and
*then* parks; the re-invocation after an approval (``ctx.tool_call_approved``) is the one
that accepts it. The name is declared in ``GATED_TOOLS`` for the same reason every other
tool that gates this way declares itself: a name missing from that union is missing from the
operator's approval-scope vocabulary.

**All three are exempt from the level gate** (``services/permissions.PLANNING_TOOLS``).
``plan_enter`` only ever narrows, ``plan_read`` reaches nothing, and ``plan_submit`` is held
by its own approval rather than by the level — which it has to be, since the level it would
be held by is the one it exists to end.
