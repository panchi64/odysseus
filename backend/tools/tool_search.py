"""Dormant categories — the two halves of a group the model loads for itself.

An expensive category the average turn never opens is still paid for on every request:
its schemas ride in the prompt whether or not a page is loaded or an inbox is read. The
browser alone outweighs the standing brief. Pydantic AI's deferred loading is the answer
to that, and it needs exactly two things from us that the library cannot supply:

- **a way in** — ``tool_search_capability``: the ``ToolSearch`` capability, configured
  with a strategy that understands *groups*. The library's own keyword overlap ranks
  individual tools, which is the wrong unit here: a turn that decides it needs the
  browser needs the whole browser, not the four ``browse_*`` tools whose descriptions
  happen to share a word with the query. Naming a dormant category reveals all of it;
  anything else falls back to keyword matching, so a query like "send an email" still
  finds its way in without the model knowing the group's name.
- **a reason to look** — ``dormant_index_instructions``: one line per dormant group in
  the standing brief. Deferred loading is invisible by construction; a model that is
  never told the browser exists will never search for it, and will instead say it
  cannot open a page. The index is what makes the saving safe, and it is deliberately
  the cheapest possible form of it — a name and a summary, no schemas, no counts that
  churn from turn to turn and cost the prompt-prefix cache the whole history behind it.

Nothing here decides *what* to load. The chassis withholds and the model reveals; there
is no relevance heuristic anywhere in the path, which is the same posture the enabled
gate takes about tools generally (``toolsets.py``).
