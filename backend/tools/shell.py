"""The `shell` category — running commands in a code conversation's worktree.

Four tools: `run_command` (blocking), `start_command` / `check_command` / `stop_command`
(background), so a dev server or a long test run is a process the agent checks on rather
than a turn that blocks for ten minutes. Rebound per run to the project's worktree, the
same way `files` is. The mechanics are in ``services/sandbox/shell_runner.py``; this file
is the contract the model sees, and the one place that turns what the model *said* into
the boundary the OS holds it to.

**The two executing tools take a third argument: `reach`.** The model states how far a
command needs to go — the worktree, the network, or the operator's whole machine — and
this file turns that declaration into an OS fence profile
(``services/sandbox/fence.workspace_profile``) which ``FencedShell`` spawns the command
under. A `workspace` command that writes outside the worktree, or reaches the network at
all, fails *inside* the fence with a note it can act on instead of quietly succeeding. The
same declaration is what the permission layer rules on
(``services/permissions/judge.py``), so what a command was cleared for and what it can
actually do are one statement rather than two that drift.

**Three layers, one line each, and they do not overlap.** The model *declares* a reach;
this file *translates* it into a profile; ``FencedShell`` *applies* the profile to a
process. Nothing below this file knows what a reach is, and nothing above it builds a
sandbox config. That is the seam to preserve — a fence detail leaking up into the tool, or
a permissions concept leaking down into the runner, is how this becomes two mechanisms
again.

**The fence is required here.** Every command is wrapped by OS-level confinement — the
credential paths and the data directory unreadable, writes landing in the worktree and the
build caches, egress only where the declared reach allows (loopback stays open, so a dev
server and its tests work; ``services/sandbox/host.py`` states what that leaves reachable).
Unlike the host hatch, which degrades and says so because the operator approved *that
specific command*, this refuses when the platform has no primitive: nobody consented to an
unfenced agent shell, and a code conversation is a long stretch of commands nobody reads
one by one.

**Reads are the one half of a declaration the fence cannot hold.** The runtime offers a
read denylist and no read allowlist, so what bounds a read is the stage that ruled on the
command (``services/permissions/judge.py``, ``shell_ast.py``) — never this wrapper. What
the fence makes binding is the *write* and *egress* halves. The tracked working directory
is contained for the same reason: the judge measures relative paths against the worktree
root, so a `cd` that escaped it would leave every later containment claim measured against
the wrong place (``FencedShell._apply_captured_cwd``).

**The fence is applied to every command — cleared or not.** A declaration is a statement
about the command, and it costs nothing to hold a command to its own statement whether the
operator approved it by hand or a review cleared it. In particular a command the
deterministic stage *declined* is still fenced to what it declared: its refusals are about
readability, and keying the fence off them would let a command escape by being written so
nothing could read it. The two exceptions are the approver's own — see :func:`_profile`.

What makes that affordable is everything around it: the throwaway branch the edits land
on, the merge the operator has to approve, one approval on the conversation's first
command, `denied_env_patterns` keeping the operator's model keys out of every spawned
environment, the git config pins that take the keys turning an ordinary `git status` into
an execution back off the repository (``services/sandbox/gitenv.py``), and code mode being
chosen for a thread bound to a project they named. An allowlist of programs was considered
instead of all of it and rejected twice over: an agent writing code needs whatever build
tool the project uses, so any allowlist honest enough to be useful is long enough to be
meaningless, and it would still be bypassable through an allowed interpreter. Bounding
what a spawned program may *do* covers `make`, `npm run` and a test suite without naming
any of them.

**Refused outright outside a worktree mode.** `mode_disabled_tools` already hides these
tools from every mode whose spec does not admit the `shell` category, but that is a
filter, and a filter is the wrong place for the only thing standing between a host command
and a sandbox thread. The check is here too.

    **Built from the declaration, not from a judgement**, and that separation is the whole

    the boundary is*. Nothing is threaded through the park, the approval payload or the
    resume, and a call the operator approved by hand at another level is fenced identically,
    having never passed a gate at all.

    Keying it off the deterministic stage instead would hand the model the boundary as a
    lever. That stage declines `ls $(true)` and `git commit -m 'fix the parser'` for being
    *unreadable* — not for reaching anywhere — so running what it declined unwrapped would
    let any command escape the fence by being written so nothing could read it, and the

    declaration asks for the unfenced machine, which is what the approver was shown — and

    cannot fence rather than an operator who chose not to. A declaration the command's own

    approved in the words it was read in, and fencing it to the reach it plainly does not
    have would break that act rather than bound it.

    **An empty allowed-domains list is not one of them.** A `network` declaration with
    nothing allowed still runs fenced, with no egress at all — the command fails at the
    boundary and says so, which is the whole point of the declaration. Reading the empty
    list as "no list to hold it to" and lifting the fence inverted the setting: an operator
