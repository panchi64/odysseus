"""Attachments tool — (re-)stage an attached file into this run's workspace.

Every attachment is already staged eagerly, at the moment it is attached
(``agent/attachments.py``), and the turn's marker names the path. This tool is the
**recovery** path for the case that marker warns about: sandbox sessions are
per-conversation and recyclable, so a replayed thread can find nothing at the path it was
told about. Calling this re-stages the original bytes at the same path. It also serves an
attachment from an older turn the agent wants to compute on now.

*Which* workspace comes from the run's resolver (``tools/workspace.py``), not from the
sandbox directly — a code thread stages into its worktree, where its file and shell
tools can actually reach the file.

It **provisions**, never reads: the file's bytes go into the workspace, not through the
model. It complements ``corpus_retrieve`` (semantic text search over a document) with a
"give me the actual file to compute on" path.

Thin like every tool: the upload store decrypts the bytes, ``services.sandbox.staging``
writes them (the same code the eager attach-time path runs, so both land on the same
path for the same file), and this adapter translates a missing capability / bad id into
something the model can act on.
