"""Mail tools (`EMAIL-1..4`) — the agent's read/write access to the operator's mailboxes.

A thin adapter over :class:`services.mail.MailService`, with two rules that make it
different from the other toolsets:

**Every message body is untrusted.** Mail is the one ingress an attacker fully controls —
they choose the words, and those words land in the model's context. So *nothing* read from
a mailbox reaches the model unfenced: subjects, sender names, snippets, summaries and
bodies all go through :mod:`core.untrusted` (`XC-SEC-5`). The fence carries a per-call
nonce the content cannot predict, so a message cannot forge its own closing marker to
"break out" of the fence and issue instructions.

**Sending is sensitive.** ``mail_send`` and ``mail_reply`` are ``requires_approval=True``
(`AE-3.1`): they leave the machine, they cannot be undone, and they speak in the operator's
name. Each carries a plain-language ``explanation`` the operator judges on the approval
prompt, exactly like ``code_run_host_command``. Reading, listing, marking and drafting are
not gated — they are reversible and stay inside the workspace.
