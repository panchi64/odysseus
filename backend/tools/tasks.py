"""The agent's own task list — the checklist the operator watches it work through.

``pydantic_ai_harness.Planning`` owns the tools and their machinery; we supply the storage
(``services/task_list`` — sealed, per-conversation), the surface, and the names.

**This is not the plan.** A *plan* here is the written document a Plan-level turn produces
for the operator to approve (``tools/plan.py``); this is the running checklist the agent
keeps for itself while it works, at every level. They were one thing under one word, which
is why the word is spent carefully now: nothing in this module says "plan" to the model.

**Registered as a toolset, not as a capability, on purpose.** The capability form also
injects the list as a tail reminder through its own model-request hook. Taking it whole
would have put the tools outside the one thing every other tool passes through: the
namespaced, operator-toggleable catalog (``tools/catalog.py``) whose promise is that the
settings list and the agent's actual stack cannot diverge. So the toolset comes from the
capability and the reminder is re-delivered through the seam this codebase already has for
exactly this — a ``PromptContextProvider``, which lands at the *tail* of the turn's prompt
for the same prompt-cache reason the harness places it there.

**Three tools, not six.** ``write`` already replaces the whole list, so ``add_task``/
``remove_task`` are the same edit spelled longer, and ``update_statuses`` covers
``update_task_status`` with a list of one. Each dropped tool cost a name, a description and
a JSON schema on every request to buy the model a second way to do something it could
already do — and a second way is a decision it has to make.

**The three are renamed on the way out** (:data:`_UPSTREAM`). The harness registers them by
hardcoded string — ``write_plan``, ``update_task_statuses``, ``read_plan`` — and validates
any allowlist against those, so the names cannot be chosen upstream. Prefixed by the
category they would reach the model as ``tasks_write_plan``: the exact collision this split
exists to remove, restated in the one place the model actually reads. So the toolset maps
the names in ``get_tools`` and maps them back in ``call_tool``, and the harness never sees
a name it did not register.
