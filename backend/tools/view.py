"""View tools — the agent shows the operator what it built, in one versioned View.

A conversation has a single **View**: a canvas beside the chat that holds a history
of **versions** to compare against, optionally fronted by a live, interactive
**head**. A ``show`` is the only thing that mints a version: it captures the sandbox
workspace as a new version (the version's *code*, via ``services/workspace_history``)
and stamps **how it previews**:

- ``show(file=…)`` captures the file's bytes as the version's preview (via
  ``services/artifacts``) — an image, an HTML page, a snippet — rendered by kind.
- ``show(serve=…)`` runs a server in the sandbox and emits ``view.live`` — the
  backend reverse-proxies it into a sandboxed iframe — overlaid on the version.

Every version is one ``view.snapshot`` event carrying its preview descriptor; the
workspace tree behind it is the comparable, diffable code. If the sandbox or the
version store isn't wired into the run, the tool says so rather than failing — the
model adapts (graceful degradation).
