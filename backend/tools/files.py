"""Filesystem tools over the agent's own sandbox workspace (`AE-2` Filesystem).

The agent's other way to touch files is ``code_execute``, which means editing by heredoc
and reading by ``cat``. That works and is miserable: every edit rewrites a whole file
through a shell, and every read costs a container round-trip. These tools are the direct
route — read a slice, replace an exact span, grep, glob — so the model spends its turn on
the problem rather than on shell quoting.

**We do not hand-roll them.** ``pydantic_ai_harness.FileSystem`` is the Pydantic team's
own capability: eight tools whose containment (``..``, absolute paths, and symlinks that
``realpath`` outside the root are all rejected), binary detection, hash-checked edits and
``ModelRetry`` errors are theirs to maintain. We supply one thing they cannot know — which
directory this run may touch.

**Which directory is per-run, and the category object is not.** Categories are assembled
once at app startup (see ``app.py``) and shared by every conversation, while the workspace
belongs to the run. So the root cannot be baked in at construction:
this category is a :class:`~tools.rebound.WorkspaceToolset`, which asks
``tools/workspace.py``'s resolver per call and dispatches into a ``FileSystemToolset``
bound to *that* directory.

**The invariant is that these tools reach exactly what this run can execute in, and
nothing else.** In a sandbox mode that is the conversation's sandbox workspace at
``<data_dir>/sandbox/work/<key>/`` — the host side of the container's ``/work`` bind
mount, the box's own scratch space, never the operator's files — so they reach exactly
what ``code_execute`` reaches. In code mode it is the project's git worktree, which is
exactly what the shell tools run in. Either way editing and running agree, which is the
whole point of resolving the workspace once (``services/workspace.py``).

They are still not host filesystem tools: a worktree is a throwaway branch checkout, and
the operator's own tree is only ever written by an explicit, approval-gated merge. Being
confined either way, they need no approval, exactly as sandboxed execution doesn't.
