"""Skill tools — the agent opens a playbook and works from it (`SKILL-2`, `SKILL-3`).

Skills follow the **Agent Skills** standard's progressive disclosure, and these tools are
levels two and three of it:

1. Every *published* skill's name and description is already in the turn's instructions
   (``agent/engine.py`` injects the catalog), so the model knows what exists without a call.
2. ``open`` returns the skill's full ``SKILL.md`` instructions — the level the model pays for
   only when a skill is actually relevant.
3. ``open`` **also stages the bundle into the run's workspace** under ``skills/{name}/``,
   so the supporting files are real files: references to read, scripts to run. *Which*
   workspace comes from the resolver (``tools/workspace.py``) — the conversation's sandbox
   in a sandbox thread, the project's git worktree in a code one — so a skill's scripts are
   always somewhere this run can actually execute them. In a sandbox thread that means
   nothing about a skill ever touches the host; in a code thread they land in the
   worktree, in the git-ignored directory the run's own scratch lives in.

``create`` and ``edit`` let the agent write skills down as it learns them. ``create``
always writes a **draft**: publishing is the operator's act, and it is what makes a skill
visible to the model at all. That split is also the seam `SKILL-4` (auto-publishing
high-confidence recoveries) will plug into — and it is why ``create`` is not marked
sensitive while ``edit``, which rewrites something already published and therefore
already being followed, is (`AE-3`).

Thin like every tool here: the format rules, sealing, and validation live in
``services/skills``; a missing capability degrades to a message the model can act on.
