"""Encoding a reply in the OpenAI chat-completions wire format, both shapes.

Both shapes in one module because they have to agree. The same scripted reply is
delivered either as a single body or as a sequence of deltas, and a client that gets a
tool call one way and not the other is being told two different things by one fixture —
which is the hardest kind of test failure to read, because the fixture is the part
nobody suspects.

The streaming shape is the fiddly one, and the fiddliness is all in tool calls: the name
and id arrive once, in the first delta for that index, and the arguments arrive as string
fragments to be concatenated. A stub that sent whole arguments in one delta would still
work against a client that concatenates, and would therefore never exercise the path
where a real server splits them — so this splits them deliberately.
