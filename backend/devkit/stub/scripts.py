"""What the stub says, and how a test tells it what to say.

Scenarios are matched on **the last user message**, not on how many requests have been
made. That distinction is the whole design. An agent turn is a loop — the model answers,
a tool runs, the model is asked again with the result appended — so a script keyed by
call index says something different depending on how many tools the agent decided to
call, which is precisely the thing under test. Keyed by what the user actually asked,
the same script produces the same conversation however the loop unfolds.

A scenario answers every matching request unless it is given a ``uses`` count, and a
counted one is consumed — so a two-step exchange is scripted by pushing two scenarios
with the same match, the first with ``uses=1``: its reply asks for a tool, and the second
answers with the tool's result. Once the counted ones are spent the default reply takes
over, which is what keeps an agent that decided to loop once more from hanging.
