"""Which ports a dev instance gets, and why it gets the same ones tomorrow.

Ports are allocated in **slots** rather than one at a time: a slot is a whole triple
(backend, frontend, stub) at the same offset, so an instance's three services are always
a fixed distance apart and one number identifies the lot. That is worth more than the
packing it wastes — the number appears in a URL the operator reads, in a CORS origin, in
a generated launch config, and in whatever a future session is about to be told, and a
triple that could drift apart is three things to keep in step instead of one.

The bases sit clear of 8000 and 5173, which is where the operator's own instance lives.
That separation is structural rather than checked-for: no slot can reach those numbers,
so there is no arithmetic to get wrong and no conflict to detect.

Allocation happens **once**, when an instance is first created, and is then recorded.
A later run reads the recorded slot back rather than re-deriving it, because by then the
instance's own services are usually listening on those ports and a fresh probe would
read its own backend as a conflict and move it — renaming URLs out from under whoever
was using them.
