"""Running the fixture pack against a live instance.

Separate from :mod:`devkit.seed` so that the pack stays a set of fixtures and this stays
the one place that knows how to reach an instance — which client, which base URL, whether
a login is needed. A fixture should be three lines against a route; everything else that
seeding involves is here.

Synchronous on the outside, because the launcher is: ``up`` is a sequence of steps and
one of them happens to be asynchronous inside.
