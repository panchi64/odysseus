"""How a fixture registers, and how the pack knows it has changed.

Fixtures write **through the HTTP API**, never into the stores directly. Direct writes
would skip vault sealing, the ownership checks, the conversation write-behind drainer and
the embed-on-persist path — so the rows would not be shaped like real rows, and a surface
that renders them proves nothing about the surface that renders the operator's. It is
slower and it is the point.

The version is **derived, never declared**. A hand-maintained number is a number somebody
forgets, and a forgotten bump means a stale workspace silently disagreeing with the code
— which a future session then debugs as a ghost. Hashing the fixture sources and the
migration set means adding a fixture or a migration re-seeds on the next ``up`` without
anyone deciding to.
