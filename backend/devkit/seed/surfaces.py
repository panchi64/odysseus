"""The rest of the surfaces: calendar, memory, tasks, projects, corpus.

One module rather than five, because each is the same three lines against a different
route and five files repeating that shape would be five places to keep a convention. If
any one of these grows a real setup — a corpus that needs documents written first, a
project that needs a repository — it earns its own file then.

Every fixture here is **idempotent by inspection**: it asks what is already there and
does nothing if the surface is populated. Re-seeding happens whenever the fixture pack
changes, and a pack that doubled its own rows each time would turn a version bump into a
slowly growing pile.
