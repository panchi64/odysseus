"""The one fixture everything else depends on: a model the instance can actually use.

An instance with no model bound is not merely emptier — most of the product does not
work. Chat cannot answer, titles cannot be generated, memories cannot be embedded, and
the surfaces that would show a change render an error instead. So this runs first, and
everything after it can assume a working ``main``.

By default that is the stub. When ``ODY_DEV_CHAT_*`` names a real endpoint, this binds
that instead — same seam, same registry row, so nothing downstream knows the difference.
