"""Threads, made the way threads are actually made.

There is no route that inserts a conversation — a conversation is what happens when
someone sends a message, so this sends messages and waits for the runs to finish. That is
slower than writing rows would be, and it is the only honest option: the transcript
shape, the branch tree, the title, the token accounting and the message ordering are all
produced by the engine, and a hand-built row would differ from a real one in exactly the
ways a rendering bug hides in.

It doubles as the instance's smoke test. If seeding produces threads, the whole path —
registry, engine, provider adapter, run substrate, event stream, persistence — worked.
