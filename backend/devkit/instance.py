"""One dev instance: where its data lives, which ports it holds, how it is configured.

A dev instance is a second, disposable Odysseus that an agent can drive without touching
the operator's. Everything separating the two is here, and all of it is ordinary
``Settings`` the app already reads from the environment — there is no dev-only code path
inside the app, which is the point: what runs under an agent is the same program the
operator runs, or it proves nothing.

**Keyed by git worktree.** This project is developed in several worktrees at once, and
two of them running the same instance would share a database and fight over ports. The
worktree's own directory name is the key, so isolation follows the way the work is
actually organised without anyone choosing a name.

**Rooted outside the repository.** ``~/.odysseus/dev/<worktree>/`` rather than somewhere
under the checkout: a worktree is deleted when its branch lands, and a data directory
inside one would be deleted with it. It also puts the instance's database beyond any
reach of ``.gitignore`` being edited, which matters for a directory holding an encrypted
workspace shaped exactly like the operator's real one.
