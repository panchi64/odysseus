"""The command surface — what a session actually types.

Written for a reader that arrives with no context and one turn to spend. Two rules
follow from that, and they are why this module exists rather than a handful of scripts:

**Every command takes ``--json``.** A session that has to parse prose to learn a port
number will eventually parse it wrong, and be confidently wrong afterwards. The human
form is a convenience over the machine form, never the only form.

**Output ends with the next action, spelled out.** Knowing the state and knowing what to
do about it are different things, and a message that reports only the first leaves the
reader to guess the second.
