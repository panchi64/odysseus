"""Bringing the instance up, and keeping it up.

``up`` **converges** rather than starts. It looks at what is already listening and fills
in only the gaps, so running it twice is safe, cheap, and the right thing to do when you
cannot remember whether a previous session left it running — which, for a session that
cannot see what came before it, is always. The alternative, a command that fails or
duplicates when something is already up, makes the first thing a reader must establish
"is it running?" rather than "what do I want to do?".

The backend is started through ``dev.py`` rather than uvicorn directly: it holds the
reload exclusions, and a dev instance is exactly where an agent writes files into the
data directory and would otherwise restart the server underneath its own work.
