"""Pointing a dev instance at a real model instead of the stub.

The stub is right for almost everything — deterministic, free, scriptable, offline — and
wrong for the one question it cannot answer: whether a *model* handles something. A tool
description that reads ambiguously, a prompt that invites the wrong tool, an instruction
a small local model ignores; none of those show up against a fixture that says what it
was told to.

So the same three environment variables ``evals/`` already uses, spelled for this
purpose. All three present and the seeded ``main`` endpoint points at that endpoint
instead, and the launcher does not start a stub at all. Fewer than three is treated as
none, because a half-configured endpoint that silently fell back to the stub would be
read as the real model behaving strangely.
