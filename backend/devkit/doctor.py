"""Checks that answer "why is this not working", each carrying its own fix.

The failure mode worth designing against is not a session that gets no information — it
is one that gets a true statement and still does the wrong thing next. "Port 8200 is in
use" is true and useless; "port 8200 is held by something that is not this instance's
backend — stop it, or delete instance.json to be given another slot" is the same fact with
the next move attached.

So every check returns a remedy alongside its verdict, and the remedy is a sentence
someone can act on without reading this package.
