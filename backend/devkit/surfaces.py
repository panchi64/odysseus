"""Writing the files a future session will actually read.

Both surfaces a fresh Claude Code session reads — ``.claude/`` and ``CLAUDE.md`` — are
gitignored, on purpose. That has a consequence worth stating plainly, because it is the
whole reason this module exists: **writing them by hand solves this session and nothing
after it.** A new clone does not have them. A new git worktree does not have them, and
this project is developed in several worktrees at once, so a fresh worktree is the
ordinary case rather than the rare one.

So ``docs/dev-instance.md`` is committed and is the source of truth, and these are
materialized from it on every ``up``. A fresh checkout gets them the first time anyone
starts an instance, and they are rewritten afterwards — which matters more than it sounds,
since they carry this instance's ports and a stale copy would aim a session at another
worktree's instance.

Writes are confined to the files named here, and the ``CLAUDE.md`` one is a delimited
block replaced in place: the operator's own notes live in that file too, and a generator
that rewrote it wholesale would be a generator nobody could leave switched on.
