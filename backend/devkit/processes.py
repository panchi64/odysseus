"""Starting the three services, waiting for them, and taking down only what we started.

"Only what we started" is the whole point of the module. ``up`` is meant to *converge* —
run it against a half-running instance and it fills in the gaps — which means it must be
able to tell a service it launched from one that was already there. Killing a backend
somebody else was using, on the way out of a command that was supposed to be idempotent,
is the kind of surprise that makes a tool untrustworthy after one occurrence.

Logs go to files rather than to this process's own output. Three interleaved streams are
unreadable, and a session that wants to know why the backend would not start is better
served by a path it can open than by a wall of text it has to have been watching for.
