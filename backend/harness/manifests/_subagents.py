"""Launching a sub-agent, and reading one back — the implementation.

The abstraction lives in ``services/subagents/``, where ``tools/`` can name it; this is the
half that composes an actual chat turn, and so has to sit up here with the wiring. Private
module (the leading underscore keeps manifest discovery from mistaking it for a feature)
beside the manifest that builds it, the same split ``_research_threads.py`` uses and for
the same reason.

Everything here is ordinary, and that is the entire point. There is no sub-agent engine —
no run loop, no step budget of its own, no progress protocol, no second way of holding a
message history. Launching one is: make a conversation, decide how far it may reach and
which files it works on, and submit exactly the turn a route would have submitted. Reading
one is: what did it say, and is it still going. The shortness of this module against what
the deleted blocking delegation used to be is the evidence that nothing was rebuilt.

        agent files, because a launch handle and an agent file's name are read in the same
        places by the same eyes. The *uniqueness* is here because it is a fact about the

        ``explorer``s in one step has no way to know what the other two took.

        Suffixed rather than refused on a clash. A launch is the expensive thing the model
        just decided to do; failing it over a name would spend a retry re-deciding, and the
        suffix is legible enough that ``explorer-2`` in a report is obviously the second
        explorer. The returned handle is therefore what the caller must tell the model,
        never what it asked for.

        **Reserved, not merely read.** A model launching three ``explorer``s in one step
        launches them *concurrently*, and a launch does not write its row until a whole
        turn has been composed — so three reads of the register would all answer "nothing
        taken" and all three would be called ``explorer``, after which ``by_handle`` lands
        every direction on the newest and the other two are unaddressable for good. So the

#: The tools a sub-agent is never offered. Depth stays 1 by construction rather than by a
#: counter somebody has to remember to increment: a tree of agents is unbounded cost and
#: unbounded blast radius, and nothing about the work needs one.
#:
#: ``send`` and ``list`` are here for a second reason, and it is not depth. Nothing about a
#: sub-agent's job needs to reach another one, and both of these are shaped to reach one:
#: ``list`` enumerates a thread's sub-agents and ``send`` redirects one with text the
#: envelope frames as coming from the agent that launched it. Addressing is now scoped to
#: the launching thread — a sub-agent asking about its *own* thread would find nothing,
#: because it launched nothing — so this is belt and braces rather than the only thing
#: holding the door; it stays because a tool that can only ever return nothing is a tool
#: the model spends a call discovering is useless. (``subagents_read`` stays for the
#: mirror-image reason: it only reads, and with no way to launch, a sub-agent has no handle
#: to read but ones it never created.)
