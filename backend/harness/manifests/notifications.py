"""The attention surface (`AE-3.2`) — a durable notification record + its own live
stream, separate from the frozen per-run event protocol.

The substrate records/streams what it's told; the *emit policy* — which run
outcomes are noteworthy — lives here too, as run-terminal hooks: the
approval-backstop resolve and the conversation-linked completion/failure notices.
Out-of-band channels (email through the operator's own mailbox, a push webhook)
compose in at construction.
