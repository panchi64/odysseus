"""What happens when a sub-agent finishes: its report reaches the thread that launched it.

This is the half that makes sub-agents asynchronous rather than merely non-blocking. The
launching turn does not wait — it starts sub-agents, carries on, and ends. Something has to
carry each report back afterwards and get the model working again, and that something is
here.

**It rides the mid-turn steering road, and that is the whole design.** A report is queued on
the parent's Run exactly as an operator's typed message is, and ``agent/turn.py`` hands a
queued message to the *next, not-yet-sent* model request — on a node ``agent.iter()`` yields
before it streams. So a sub-agent finishing while the parent is mid-answer cannot interrupt
it: the tokens finish, and the report lands at the following boundary. There is deliberately
no second delivery route, because a second route is how that guarantee gets lost.

**The one thing that road does not cover** is a report queued during the parent's *final*
stream, where no further request is ever made. The substrate drops what is still pending at
terminal, which is right for the operator (their client still holds their own text and
rebuilds the bubble from the replay) and silently lossy for a report, which nothing else
holds. So a terminal run is checked for undelivered reports and they are re-delivered as a
turn of their own.

**One lock per parent thread.** Two sub-agents finishing in the same instant, and a report
being re-delivered while a third lands, must not race into two turns that each replay a
history the other has moved past. Serialising per parent is what makes "several at once" the
ordinary case rather than the interesting one.
