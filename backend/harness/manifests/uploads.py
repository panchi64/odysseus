"""Uploads (`UP-*`) — a sealed file store with off-request text extraction, indexed
into the corpus.

Bytes are stored sealed and deduped by content hash; extraction drains off the
request path on a lock-aware worker (MinerU in front when detected on the host,
built-in pypdfium2 + vision OCR as the floor). Vision OCR runs a model, so it lives
in the engine layer (`agent/vision`) and is injected through a narrow seam.
