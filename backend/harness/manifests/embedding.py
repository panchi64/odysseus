"""Embedding-space healing — the reindexer and the boot-time backfill.

`EMB-2` segregates vectors by the model that produced them, so changing the embedding
endpoint strands every vector written under the old one, and content persisted before any
embedder existed has no vector at all. Two things close that gap: the `EmbeddingReindexer`
re-embeds on demand (with progress the operator can watch), and `_backfill_embeddings`
lifts whatever backlog exists once the vault is unlocked.

This lived beside local model serving while the app served its own models, because binding
a freshly served embedding model was the most common way to trigger a heal. Serving is
gone — Odysseus now speaks only to endpoints the operator points it at — but the healing is
not about *where* the embedder runs, only about the model changing underneath the vectors.
So it stands on its own here.
