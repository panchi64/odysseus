"""The sub-agents feature — autonomous agents the model launches for itself.

What a sub-agent *is* is almost nothing: a hidden conversation, composed by the same
``compose_turn`` an operator's own message goes through, running the same engine over the
same tools. So this manifest contributes three small things and no machinery.

The **launcher** (built in ``_subagents.py`` beside this file), so ``tools/subagents.py``
can start one from inside a run without importing turn composition, which sits above
``tools/``. It is built here for the same reason the research launcher and the scheduler's
task executor are: a tool has no ``Request``, and a launcher that closed over one could
never be reached from inside a run, while here every handle it needs is already resolved.

The **register** (``services/subagent_store.py``), which is what keeps a sub-agent's
transcript reachable by name once the process that ran it is gone. Its startup pass closes
out anything a previous process left running — a row still live after a restart describes
work that stopped when the process did, and left alone it would count against the operator's
cap and promise a report that is never coming.

**A sub-agent's thread notifies like any other**, because it *is* one, and its approvals
arrive through the ordinary approval route: a parked run is addressed by run id, so a
sub-agent waiting on the operator needs no surface of its own.
