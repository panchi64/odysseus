"""The browser-control feature — the agent drives a real page, in the operator's window.

This feature owns *two* things now: the visible Chromium on the host (and the SSRF proxy
it is pointed at), and the per-conversation sessions attached to it. It no longer depends
on `web` — the browser it drives is its own, not the container web fetch renders in — so
the build order is free again.

Both register a stop here, the window's *before* the sessions': the lifecycle unwinds in
reverse, so the sessions drain first and none is left attached to a window that is already
closing. Neither has anything to start — the window is launched lazily on the first
acquire, so a run of the app in which nobody browses opens none.
