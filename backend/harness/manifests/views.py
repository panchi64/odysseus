"""The View feature — one versioned output surface (head = live preview, history =
workspace snapshots).

`ArtifactStore` holds a version's preview bytes (capture-encrypted, served inert);
`WorkspaceHistoryStore` is the git-style version history a `view_show` snapshots
into; the previews router reverse-proxies the live head out of the sandbox.
