"""Slash commands — the composer's `/` menu, and the workflows the operator saves for it.

Routes, the registry the chat route resolves a picked command through, and the one store
behind the only source the registry owns. There is no toolset and no instruction provider,
deliberately: a command is something the *operator* reaches for, and the model already has
every capability behind one. Telling it that a second way to ask exists would cost every
request a paragraph and change nothing about what it can do.

That last point is worth stating rather than inferring, because a workflow looks like
something the model should know about. It is not: it is a phrase the operator has bound to a
name for their own typing, and an agent that could read the list would be reading their
shortcuts. The tail block a command produces is the only thing about it the model ever sees.

The registry reads the skill library, so this manifest builds after ``skills``.
