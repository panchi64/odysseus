"""One owner for the app's background start/stop order.

Everything long-lived the app brings up — write-behind drainers, sync loops,
container monitors, fire-and-forget startup tasks, clients that need closing —
registers here at its construction point, and shutdown becomes a single call
that unwinds in **reverse registration order**. Before this existed, the
lifespan's ``finally`` block was a hand-maintained mirror of the construction
sequence that had to be edited in exactly the right position every time a
capability landed; now the teardown position is implied by the setup position,
and only genuinely order-sensitive stops need thought (register later to stop
earlier).

``start`` runs the unit's startup *immediately* — registration does not defer
or reorder bring-up, so a capability that later construction depends on is live
by the next line, exactly as when the lifespan called ``.start()`` inline.
