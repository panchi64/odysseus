"""What a feature declares to the harness — one file names all its layered pieces.

A feature stays split across the layers (`routes/` + `tools/` + `services/` +
`models/`), because the layer law is what keeps the dependency direction honest;
its *cohesion* lives here instead: a single `FeatureManifest` in
``harness/manifests/<name>.py`` declares the routers it serves, the API scopes it
claims, the services it builds, and the hooks it registers. The harness discovers
manifests by walking that package — presence is registration, the same contract as
``models/_discovery`` and the backup marker — so landing a feature never edits a
central list.
