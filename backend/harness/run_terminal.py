"""The run-terminal dispatch point — features compose the policy, the substrate
stays feature-free.

``runs/`` only knows it holds an optional ``on_terminal`` callback; this dispatcher
is what the app injects there. Features contribute hooks through their manifests
instead of the lifespan hardcoding every feature's terminal behavior in one
closure:

- a **sync hook** runs inline in the terminal transition, for bookkeeping that must
  be observable before anything else reacts (resolving a waiter future another
  request is awaiting);
- an **async hook** runs as a background task — tracked in ``tasks`` so shutdown
  can drain them before the stores they read stop — and receives ``watched``,
  whether anyone was subscribed to the run's stream at the moment it settled
  (captured synchronously here, because reading it later would race the stream's
  own subscriber cleanup).
