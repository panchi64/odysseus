"""Find every feature manifest — presence in ``harness/manifests/`` is registration.

The walk imports each module in the package and collects its ``MANIFEST``. Order is
a deterministic topological sort over the manifests' ``after`` edges (ties broken
by name), so construction order follows declared dependencies — never a central
list, never import order luck.
